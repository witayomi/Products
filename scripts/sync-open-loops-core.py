"""sync-open-loops-core.py — keep the marker-delimited shared blocks in step.

A handful of blocks live in exactly one source file and are embedded verbatim in
many other files. This script copies each source's canonical text into every
target that carries the matching marker pair, so a fix to the source lands
everywhere at once. The registry of what syncs where is system/system-of-records.md.

Six blocks are synced:

  - open-loops-core  <- prompts/_open-loops-core-block.md
        embedded in every context-doc-generating prompt
  - expertise-core   <- prompts/_expertise-core-block.md
        embedded in the same prompts
  - parker-voice     <- prompts/_parker-voice-block.md
        embedded in the brand-brain CLAUDE.md files (here: the template)
  - brand-intake     <- prompts/_brand-intake-context-block.md
        embedded in a targeted subset of generating prompts (audits, account
        reads, strategy inputs, brief creation, personas, competitor syntheses)
  - team-conversations <- prompts/_team-conversations-source-block.md
        embedded in the Phase-1 team-knowledge reads
  - reading-level    <- prompts/_reading-level-block.md
        embedded in the Phase-1 doc-generating prompts only (audits, brand
        profile, competitor profile, personas, voice-of-customer, market
        synthesis, open-loops roll-up); not Phase 2 or Phase 3

How a block is delimited:
  - In the SOURCE file, the canonical text sits between `<!-- BLOCK-START -->`
    and `<!-- BLOCK-END -->` (marker lines excluded).
  - In each TARGET file, it sits between `<!-- NAME:start ... -->` and
    `<!-- NAME:end -->`. The start marker keeps its descriptive suffix; only the
    text between the markers is replaced. The result is byte-identical to the
    source.

The source is always anchored to THIS repo (the factory canon). What changes is
where targets are looked for: by default the script's own repo, but `--scan` can
point it at another tree — e.g. a brand brain whose root CLAUDE.md carries the
parker-voice markers. propagate-to-brand-brains.sh uses this to refresh each
brain's CLAUDE.md from the factory source after it mirrors the bundle.

Usage:
    scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py                     # write: sources -> targets in this repo
    scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py --check             # report drift in this repo, write nothing, exit 1 if any
    scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py --scan PATH         # write: factory sources -> targets found under PATH
    scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py --check --scan PATH # report drift under PATH

`--scan` is repeatable. Targets are discovered by scanning for the marker pair,
so a new embed is picked up automatically once it carries the markers.
