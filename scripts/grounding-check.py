"""grounding-check: deterministic scan for ungrounded creative/strategy output.

The mechanical layer of the grounding gate. The judgment layer is the
context-grounding-review agent (.claude/agents/context-grounding-review.md),
which runs this first and then decides what the findings mean.

Three checks, all cold:

1. VERBATIM TRACE — every quoted phrase in the output is searched for across
   the brain's markdown. TRACED means it exists in the vault (a real customer
   phrase, a real corpus line). UNTRACED means it appears nowhere on disk —
   either it came from a live tool pull in this session (the reviewer
   verifies that) or it was invented (fabrication). The check cannot tell
   those apart; it exists so no invented quote passes silently as sourced.

2. SOURCE EXISTENCE — every backticked file path the output claims as a
   source must exist on disk, tried against the layout prefixes (factory
   and brand-brain paths). A named source that resolves nowhere is a
   decorative citation.

3. RECEIPT PRESENCE — the output contracts require visible receipts
   (Brand Context Applied, Voice Review, the sign-off stamps). Reports
   which are present and which are absent; the reviewer knows which the
   deliverable type requires.

Usage:
    python3 grounding-check.py OUTPUT_FILE [BRAIN_ROOT]

BRAIN_ROOT defaults to the current directory. Exit 0 = nothing flagged,
1 = findings for the judgment layer.
