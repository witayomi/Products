# propagate-to-brand-brains.sh — re-ship the factory methodology bundle into
# standing brand brains, so factory improvements reach brains that were stood
# up earlier. This is the *update-time* counterpart to the onboarding-runner's
# build-time "ship the craft" step (Phase 0). See .claude/skills/propagate-craft/SKILL.md.
#
# It auto-detects the brain's layout and mirrors accordingly.
#
# NESTED brains (current onboarding-runner layout, method bundled under parker-system/,
# all skills in .claude/skills/ where Claude Code loads them):
#   prompts/  -> parker-system/prompts/   (the generating prompts; the brain refreshes itself with these)
#   system/   -> parker-system/system/
#   templates/-> parker-system/templates/
#   creative-strategy-context/ -> parker-system/creative-strategy-context/
#   .claude/skills/ (factory craft skills, minus dream) -> .claude/skills/
#   templates/brand-routines/claude/skills/ (routine skills) -> .claude/skills/
#   templates/brand-routines/claude/{hooks/,settings.json} -> .claude/  (added if missing,
#                                          not update-only: the context hook is factory-owned
#                                          machinery and settings.json requires the script)
#   .claude/output-styles/ -> .claude/output-styles/  (the Parker voice layer; factory-owned,
#                                          added and refreshed unconditionally like the hook)
#
# FLAT standalone brains (legacy layout, craft + system at root, no factory prompts):
#   creative-strategy-context/ -> creative-strategy-context/
#   system/                             -> system/  (runtime subset only; --existing
#                                          never adds the factory-internal docs)
#   templates/brand-routines/claude/skills/ -> .claude/skills/
#   templates/brand-routines/claude/{hooks/,settings.json} -> .claude/  (same as nested)
#   .claude/output-styles/ -> .claude/output-styles/  (same as nested)
#
# DELIBERATE ADDS: --existing never adds files, so genuinely-new runtime system docs,
# routine skills, and schedule recipes a standing brain should gain are named explicitly
# in each branch (currently: system/growing-the-brain.md, the research-loops and
# update-brain skills and their schedule recipes, and the creative review gates —
# creative-strategy-context/ai-writing-tells.md, .claude/agents/creative-voice-review.md
# + context-grounding-review.md, and scripts/voice-lint.py + grounding-check.py).
# Add new ones there when the runtime ship list grows.
#   (legacy flat brains do not carry factory prompts/ or templates/, so those are skipped;
#    shipped system docs get their creative-strategy-context/ refs rewritten
#    to creative-strategy-context/)
#
# After mirroring, it runs scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py against the brain to
# refresh the marker-delimited shared blocks from factory canon — notably the
# parker-voice block in the brain's root CLAUDE.md, which lives outside
# parker-system/ and is never rsynced.
#
# What it PRESERVES (never overwritten or deleted) in each brand brain:
#   - parker-system/creative-strategy-context/_*-lens.md   (brand lens overlays, legacy nested location; current-layout brains keep brand-lens.md at the root, untouched by this sweep)
#   - parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expert-insights/ (brand intake)
#   - everything OUTSIDE parker-system/ (brand-profile, personas, strategy,
#     audits, competitors, open-loops, running-notes, sub-context-docs,
#     CLAUDE.md, README.md, .claude/, schedules/, prompts-run-log, ...)
#
# Sync semantics: UPDATE-ONLY (rsync --existing, no --delete). It refreshes
# every file the brain ALREADY has to match the factory, but it does NOT add
# factory-only files (so product-internal docs like product-brain-CLAUDE.md,
# repo-boundary-and-promotion-model.md, or the propagate-craft skill never leak
# into a brand brain) and does NOT delete anything (brand-specific files and
# anything the brain intentionally keeps are preserved). Genuinely-new
# methodology docs a brain SHOULD gain are added deliberately, not by this
# sweep — see the skill doc. Brand brains are git repos, so changes are
# recoverable from history.
#
# Usage: scripts/propagate-to-brand-brains.sh [brand-repo ...]
#   If no arguments are passed, set PARKER_BRAND_BRAIN_REPOS to a space-separated
#   local default list.
# Requires: gh (authenticated), rsync, git.
