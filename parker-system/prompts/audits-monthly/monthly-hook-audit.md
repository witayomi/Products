# Prompt — monthly hook audit

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

<!-- reading-level:start — synced from prompts/_reading-level-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.
<!-- reading-level:end -->

<!-- brand-intake:start — synced from prompts/_brand-intake-context-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The brand intake, if it exists, is provided context. Load it before you generate.** At kickoff the team may have answered a short intake covering what Parker cannot observe on its own: their primary campaign objective, north-star metric and how they define a winner, ad naming convention, whether they read performance from in-platform numbers or a third-party tool, their main business objective, their competitor list, their brief format, and optionally their unit economics. When present this lives in `running-notes/brand-rules.md` and `running-notes/success-definition.md`, with the competitor list in `competitors/_competitive-set.md` and the brand's brief format saved verbatim at `briefs/_brief-template.md`. Read whatever is there before you start, and let it shape the work.

Treat it by kind. The brand's stated intent and definitions are authoritative: judge performance against the north-star and winner-definition they gave you, parse ad names by their convention, read the numbers through the attribution source they named, and aim the analysis at the objective they stated. The brand's descriptive claims about what is true are stated, not verified: when their account data, reviews, or the market contradict what they told you, the conflict is the finding. Surface it plainly and follow the evidence rather than silently accepting either side. Never launder a stated claim into a verified fact in the retelling.

**If the intake is missing or partial, run as normal.** The intake makes the work sharper, it is never a gate. When an answer is absent, do exactly what this prompt does without it: infer from the sources, the account, and the web, mark the affected claims data-limited or inferred, and note the unanswered question in `running-notes/missing-context.md` so it can be filled later. Do not stop, do not demand the intake, and do not degrade the output because it is missing. A brain with no intake at all still produces the full doc.
<!-- brand-intake:end -->

This produces `YYYY-MM-hook-audit.md`, the brand's monthly read on what hooks are working — for the brand, for competitors, for affinity and inspo brands, and on recent organic social in the brand's niche. Its single job is to brief a senior creative strategist on every hook worth knowing about this month, with enough examples and detail that the strategist can decide what to test next.

You are a senior creative strategist briefing yourself before a hook-testing planning session. Write plainly and directly. Lead with what is true and why it matters.

Brand-profile, user-profile, the brand's ideas doc, the brand's hook history, competitor ad libraries, affinity-brand and inspo-brand reference lists, recent organic from the brand's industry and niche, the ad-account-analysis method doc, and the prior month's hook audit are passed in at runtime.

---

## Cadence and where this doc sits

Monthly. Sits next to the monthly performance report and the monthly organic TikTok audit. The performance report reads sentiment trajectory and account-level performance. The organic TikTok audit reads the body of the brand's own organic content for paid-portable ideas. This audit reads only the first three seconds — what each ad, post, or reference does to earn the click and the watch — across the brand, its competitors, affinity brands, inspo brands, and recent organic in the niche.

Take the prior month's hook audit in as context. Hooks already catalogued, exact hooks the brand has tested and what happened, and the running brainstorm of hooks-to-test are all carried forward. New hooks observed this month get added. Hooks that have died on the feed get marked.

This doc is not the iterations log. Iterations on existing hooks live elsewhere. This doc is the net-new brainstorm of hooks worth introducing.

## Use your judgment. This is expertise, not a cage.

The hook is the gate. If it fails, the rest of the ad does not matter. The goal of this audit is breadth. The more hooks you surface and describe, the more useful this doc is when the strategist comes back asking "what should we test." Lean toward capturing a hook that *might* be worth a test rather than filtering it out early.

The hook-format taxonomy at the bottom is a guide, not the universe. If a hook in the wild does not match a format on that list, capture it anyway and name the pattern in your own words. A format that is missing from the taxonomy but is clearly working is more valuable than a clean tag against the taxonomy.

One discipline matters most here. Capture each hook concretely — the actual opening line or visual, not a description of the category. A senior strategist reading this doc later needs to see what the hook is, not a paraphrase of what kind of hook it is. Describe exactly what is happening as if they are unable to watch the video, so lots of detail is required.

Write each hook as a flowing narrative paragraph, not as a choppy field list. A human describing the ad to another strategist would tell them what happens in the order the viewer experiences it, then name why that opening matters. A separated set of fields is data; a paragraph is a description.

The standard is narrative reconstruction. For every hook, assume the reader has never seen the video and needs to picture it in their head from your words alone. Describe how the first seconds unfold as a mini-scene. A label can orient the reader, but it cannot be the description. Do not turn this into a checklist of visual fields. If the source does not contain enough visual or transcript detail to reconstruct the scene, say the source is thin and describe only what is actually visible or recorded.

A mechanical, box-checked doc with thirty tagged formats and no real examples is a failure even if every field is filled.

Do not compress the external sections into a pattern read when source examples exist. The strategic goal of this document is inspiration density: more concrete hooks, more narrative reconstructions of the first seconds, more source-specific mechanics. A short synthesis paragraph is useful only after the examples have been captured. If the source set contains eight useful competitor hooks, include the eight. If an inspo brand has six active videos, include the six. If a hook is imperfect but carries a useful first-three-second mechanic, keep it and mark the caveat rather than dropping it.

## Required knowledge read

Before drafting, load:

- `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md`
- `parker-system/prompts/_notion-ai-tagging-and-foundational-context.md`

Use `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` as the paid-creative reasoning layer for this audit.

Use `_notion-ai-tagging-and-foundational-context.md` as a supporting analysis-discipline layer. Its main purpose in this audit is to remind you what information Parker gets from videos and account reads: exact script, on-screen text, first frame, pacing, movement, viewer state, emotional pressure, audience, and promo or launch context. This is not a creative-diversity audit. Do not over-index on ad-format classification, format gaps, or format tallies.

For hook audits, the tagging context should stay mostly behind the reasoning. Use it to sharpen the hook read: what the viewer sees first, what the first line makes them feel or realize, what knowledge state the hook assumes, whose problem it is, and whether the useful opening idea is independent of promo or launch context. If a format label helps clarify a specific hook, name it briefly. Do not make format the organizing principle.

Do not turn the hook audit into a full ad-account evaluation. Borrow the discipline that makes the hook read competent: read the account as a body, not as a gallery; treat volume, repetition, top placements, recent launches, and spend as strategic signals; separate public-library signal from live-account performance signal; and remember that a single ad rarely proves an account-wide pattern by itself.

For the brand's own paid account, use the method to interpret spend allocation, hook-rate signal, fatigue, repeated near-duplicates, top-spend winners, and the gap between what the hook is doing and what the full ad is doing. For competitor, affinity, and inspo libraries, use the method to read top-impression ads, recent testing direction, creative-competitor strength, absence as finding, and whether a library has enough active volume to be worth mining.

For every meaningful hook, write the first three seconds so a strategist can understand the scene without seeing the video. Make the opening feel visible as a narrative moment, then explain why that opening should stop the viewer and what problem or tension it activates. Tagging context can inform that explanation, but the output should read like a hook brief, not a taxonomy pass.

## Where this doc sits

Sibling to:

- **Monthly performance report.** Account-level trajectory and sentiment on what is already running.
- **Monthly organic TikTok audit.** The brand's own organic body, read for paid-portable ideas across the whole content piece, not just the hook.
- **Iterations log.** Iterations on existing winning hooks, kept fresh as variants ship.
- **Ideas doc.** The running brainstorm bank that this audit pours fresh hooks into and pulls signal out of.

This doc owns the first three seconds, across every relevant source — own brand, competitors, affinity, inspo, niche organic. It's good to talk about what happens after the first 3 seconds so the user can see the full picture, but we want the most detail in the first 3 seconds.

## Goal and what success looks like

A reader who has never seen the brand should be able to answer:

- What hooks is the brand currently running in paid, with the exact opening lines or frames?
- For each of the brand's hooks, how many times has it been used (or a near-identical variant), and what is the volume trajectory?
- What hooks have the brand's top competitors been running this month, especially on their highest-impression ads?
- What hooks are affinity brands and inspo brands using this month, captured concretely enough to understand the first-three-second mechanic?
- What hooks are showing up in recent organic content in the brand's industry and niche, captured concretely enough to understand why they stop the viewer?
- Which exact hooks has the brand already tested with negative, declining, fatigued, or inconclusive signal?
- Which hooks across all sources look worth carrying into the next planning conversation, and why?
- Which open questions about hooks could not be resolved this month?

If your draft does not let a reader answer those, it is not done.

## How you work on every context doc

**Why this doc exists.** A senior strategist about to plan hook tests needs the widest possible field of options in front of them, captured concretely. This doc is that field.

**Mark how you know each thing.** *Stated* when the hook text or frame is visible in the ad, post, or reference. *Inferred* when you classified the pattern from signals. *Verified* when the brand or another internal source confirms a test outcome or a usage count.

**A count is not significance, but capture the count anyway.** For each of the brand's own hooks, capture how many times the exact hook or a near-identical variant has been used. The strategist reads that volume as the fatigue signal directly. You do not need to compute a fatigue verdict.

**A blank beats a guess.** Where prior test history, exact usage counts, or impression rank is unknown, name the blank and keep the hook in the brief. Do not invent numbers.

**Carry the source.** For each hook, carry the brand or account it came from, the ad or post link or reference where it appears, and the impression or engagement signal where available.

**Form.** No parenthetical asides. No bracketed example lists. Capture hooks as direct quotes or vivid narrative reconstructions, not category labels.

## What this doc is, and why it matters

**It is the field of options for the next hook-testing cycle.** Hook testing only gets as good as the menu of candidates. Volume of well-described candidates beats a small list of pre-filtered winners. The strategist is the filter.

**It is the brand's institutional memory of what hooks have already been tried.** Exact hooks the brand has tested get marked with the evidence and the verdict type. Some should not be re-suggested. Some are fatigued. Some need a better execution. Some are still inconclusive.

**It is the cross-pollination surface.** Affinity brands, inspo brands, and recent niche organic are not the brand's direct competitors, but their hooks are the cheapest source of fresh angles. This audit makes that surface searchable.

**It is the briefing pack for Parker on hook questions.** When someone asks Parker what hooks the brand should be using, this doc is what gets referenced. The more examples it carries and the more concretely it describes them, the better Parker answers.

## Where to look and how to build it

Pull from every source. The job is breadth.

**Video-only.** Hook audits cover video hooks only. Statics are excluded from every source — brand portfolio, competitor libraries, affinity, inspo, niche organic. Filter to videos at ingestion. Statics belong in a separate static-ad audit, not here.

**Promo-led ads are context, not inspiration.** Discount, sale, coupon-code, price-drop, and holiday-promo ads do not belong in the hook inventory unless the first three seconds contain a non-promo mechanic worth learning from. It is fine to mention that a brand is leaning on promo creative as an account signal. Do not mine promo hooks as hook concepts.

**Paid-ad transcripts are expected input.** For the brand's own paid videos, Parker carries the first-three-second transcript/read for every ad. Use that transcript layer before inferring from ad names, format tags, or account metrics. Do not write that paid-ad first-three-second transcripts are unavailable unless the transcript field itself has been checked and is genuinely blank.

**Depth per source: 5 to 10 examples.** Each competitor gets 5 to 10 active videos by impression rank. Each affinity brand gets 5 to 10. Each inspo brand gets 5 to 10. Niche organic gets 5 to 10 recent breakout videos. Two or three per source is a sample; ten is the portfolio the strategist needs.

**Rotation rule.** Competitors stay constant across cycles — they are the brand's defined competitor set. Affinity brands, inspo brands, and niche-organic sources rotate each cycle. Prioritize brands and queries that were not covered in the prior month's audit. The goal is fresh inspiration every cycle, not the same accounts every month. Note which brands were pulled this cycle and which are queued for next cycle so the rotation is auditable.

**Drop irrelevant data, do not caveat.** When the underlying data tool flags miscategorization or surfaces results clearly off-brief, exclude them from the body of the audit. Put the data-quality issue in `data_limitations`, not in open loops. Do not include a hydration brand in a denim audit with a "flagging this because" caveat — drop it.

**The brand itself.**
- Every active paid video this month, opening three seconds captured as a direct transcription of the opening line plus a description of the opening visual.
- The brand's organic first frames across platforms, captured the same way.
- The brand's hook history, with exact hooks the brand has tested and the outcome where known.

**Competitors.**
- The competitor set named in the brand-profile. Locked across cycles.
- 5 to 10 active videos in each competitor's library this month, ranked by impression count. Lead with the highest-impression videos since impression volume in the library is the cheapest proxy for what is performing.
- Capture exact opening lines and vivid narrative reconstructions of the first seconds. Do not paraphrase into a category label.
- Exclude promo-led ads from the hook inventory unless the first three seconds carry a reusable non-promo mechanic. If promo ads dominate a competitor's top slate, mention the promo dependence in the pattern read rather than auditing each promo hook.

**Affinity brands.**
- Brands sharing customer overlap or value system with the brand, even from adjacent categories.
- The named affinity set lives in the brand-profile. If the set is thin, infer reasonable additions and name them as inferred.
- Rotate which affinity brands are pulled each cycle. Prioritize ones not covered in the prior month's audit.
- Pull 5 to 10 active videos per brand from paid and organic.

**Inspo brands.**
- Brands the brand-profile or user-profile names as creative inspiration, regardless of category.
- Rotate which inspo brands are pulled each cycle. Prioritize ones not covered in the prior month's audit.
- Pull 5 to 10 active videos per brand from paid and organic.

**Recent organic on social in the niche.**
- Search the brand's industry and niche on TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts for recent breakout video content.
- Rotate the search queries, hashtags, and creator clusters each cycle so the niche feed surfaces fresh material.
- Pull 5 to 10 videos. Capture the hook only. Body and CTA reads are out of lane.

**Cross-checks before recording a hook.**
- Has the brand already tested this exact hook or a near-identical variant? If yes, mark the outcome and keep the entry as a prior-test note with the correct verdict type.
- How many times has the brand or the source account already used this exact or near-identical hook? Capture the count and a rough trajectory of whether usage is climbing or plateauing.
- Does the hook appear across multiple competitors at the same time? Capture that crowdedness as a one-line note alongside the hook so the strategist can read it later, without converting it into a saturation verdict.

**The hook-performance standard.** This audit judges hooks by spend plus hook rate. Spend shows the account gave the hook a real chance or is still trusting it. Hook rate shows whether the first three seconds are stopping people. ROAS, CPA, and conversion can explain why the full ad is not working, but they do not make a high-hook-rate opener a bad hook.

Use `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` to keep this read grounded. The lenses differ by where the ad lives. For the brand's own account, spend is visible through logged-in access — a top-spend hook says the account is trusting it. For external libraries there is no spend; top-by-impressions, days-active, and most-recent are the available lenses, and impressions is a proxy for spend, not a substitute. A high-hook-rate hook says the first three seconds are doing their job. A recent cluster of near-duplicates can mean a test in progress or a winner being milked. Do not collapse those into one generic "winner" or "loser" label, and do not infer spend for an external library.

Before a hook enters the weak-hook section, separate four possibilities:
- **True weak hook.** The opening line or frame had enough spend and delivery to read, and the hook rate itself was weak against the brand's baseline or against a close control.
- **Fatigue.** The hook worked before, was used repeatedly, and now shows a weaker hook rate after volume. This is not the same as the hook never working.
- **Working hook with downstream failure.** The hook rate is healthy, but ROAS, CPA, hold, or conversion breaks later. This belongs in open loops or body-of-ad analysis, not in the weak-hook section.
- **Inconclusive.** The spend, delivery, usage count, or history is too thin to call.

Never use weak ROAS alone as proof that a hook failed. Check spend, hook rate, prior usage, launch date, iteration count, hold rate, and the nearest successful creative before writing the verdict. If the hook rate is strong and spend is meaningful, call the hook working and name the downstream problem separately.

**Intake questions to keep the cycle honest.**
- Which sources did you actually reach this month, and which were data-limited?
- Which hooks surfaced that do not fit any taxonomy format? Capture them with your own short label.
- Which competitor or affinity accounts had no ads running this month? Name the blank.
- Which affinity and inspo brands were pulled this cycle, and which are queued for next cycle?

## What goes in it

Each section below is a bolded lead-in with what to capture and why it matters strategically.

**Brand hooks in use.** Every active paid hook this month captured as the exact opening line plus a narrative reconstruction of the first seconds. For each: the awareness stage targeted where known, the number of times the brand has used this exact or near-identical hook (running total, not just this month), and a rough trajectory of that usage. The strategist reads the volume column as the fatigue signal — heavy repeat use of the exact hook is where juice gets squeezed dry.

**Brand hooks with weak attention signal.** Exact hooks the brand has run with meaningful spend and weak or declining hook rate. For each, capture the hook text, the first-three-second read, the spend, the hook rate, the closest control, and whether the signal looks like true weak hook, fatigue, or inconclusive. Do not include hooks with strong hook rates here just because ROAS is weak. Those are working hooks with downstream problems.

**Competitor hooks.** Grouped by competitor. For each: the exact opening line, a narrative reconstruction of the first seconds, and the impression rank inside that competitor's library where available. Lead with the highest-impression ads, since impression volume in the library is the cheapest proxy for what is performing. Note when the same hook appears across multiple competitors. The strategic reason: competitor hooks show which first-frame mechanics are live in the field without asking this audit to prescribe how the brand should use them.

**Affinity-brand hooks.** Captured the same way. The strategic reason: affinity brands share customer values without sharing the direct competitive read, so their hooks travel cleanly without category collision.

**Inspo-brand hooks.** Captured the same way. The strategic reason: inspo brands are where the brand earns its creative edge — these are the hooks the brand would not arrive at on its own.

**Niche organic hooks.** Recent breakout organic in the brand's industry and niche. The strategic reason: organic that is breaking now is the leading edge of what paid will work in the coming weeks.

**Open loops.** Consequential questions about hooks the audit could not resolve this month.

## The hook-format taxonomy (reference, not cage)

This is the proven set of psychological frameworks for opening an ad. Use it as a comparison set when tagging hooks. If a hook does not fit any of these, capture it with your own short label. Missing patterns are a finding, not a problem.

1. **Comment response** — respond to a comment overlay in the opener.
2. **Investment** — money or time spent before finding the solution.
3. **Scam** — "I thought this was a scam" tension and resolution.
4. **Give me time** — ask for a specific time commitment with a promised payoff.
5. **POV** — put the viewer directly in a scenario.
6. **Demographic** — call out a specific demographic or identity in the opener.
7. **Hook stacking** — stack two or three hooks back-to-back.
8. **How do I know if** — articulate the exact question the viewer is already asking.
9. **Speed and transformation** — time-based urgency plus before-and-after proof.
10. **Conversational** — open mid-conversation.
11. **Viral product** — leverage existing buzz.
12. **Reaction** — lead with authentic emotion.
13. **Controversy and anti-traditional** — break a tradition or challenge a belief.
14. **Trigger word** — words that immediately activate emotion.
15. **Myth-busting and contrarian** — challenge conventional wisdom.
16. **Educational** — promise to teach, explain, or reveal.
17. **Comparison** — set up a direct comparison between two options.
18. **Storytelling** — open with the beginning of a story.
19. **Authority** — lead with credentials, expertise, or achievement.
20. **Question** — open with a direct question.

## Execution

**Step one — pull the source inputs.** Brand-profile, user-profile, ideas doc, brand hook history, prior month's hook audit, and `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md`. Confirm the competitor set, affinity-brand set, and inspo-brand set.

**Step two — capture brand hooks in use.** Every active paid ad and every recent organic first frame. Exact opening line, vivid first-three-seconds scene description, awareness stage where known, exact-hook usage count to date, trajectory.

**Step three — mark brand hooks with weak attention signal.** Pull from the brand's hook history and the prior month's audit. Capture the exact hook, prior usage, spend, hook rate, and whether the signal looks like fatigue or true weak hook. If the hook rate is healthy but ROAS is weak, do not put it in this section. Route it to open loops as a post-hook business problem.

**Step four — capture competitor hooks.** Every active competitor ad this month. Prioritize the highest-impression ads in each library. Exact opening line, vivid first-three-seconds scene description, impression rank where available, note when the same hook appears across multiple competitors.

**Step five — capture affinity-brand hooks.** Paid and organic. Same fields as competitors.

**Step six — capture inspo-brand hooks.** Paid and organic. Same fields.

**Step seven — capture recent niche organic hooks.** Search the brand's industry and niche for recent breakout organic. Hook only.

**Step eight — write the open loops.** The few questions the audit made Parker genuinely curious about and could not resolve.

## Tools Parker calls for this run

Parker pulls the brand's own active paid videos this month with search_facebook_ads_sql, pulls competitor videos ranked by impression count with search_competitor_facebook_ads, pulls the brand's organic, affinity, inspo, and niche video with search_tiktok_videos, and finds recent breakout niche video with webSearch. For context and memory, Parker loads brand context with get_brand_persona, reads the prior period's audit through search_chat_history, and persists the result with parkerFileSystem and update_custom_working_memory.

## Output

Open with frontmatter, then the sections. Mark every claim stated, inferred, or verified. Lead with the brand-hooks-in-use section so the strategist sees the brand's current ground first, then the external surfaces in widening rings, then open loops.

## Parker media links appendix

End every audit with `## Appendix - Parker media links` as the final appendix, after open loops and after any quote, customer-language, source, or evidence appendix. Make this appendix an indexed media library, not a loose link dump. Give every source artifact a stable index ID in the form `M001`, `M002`, `M003`, continuing in order through the appendix. Include the source name or ad name, the Parker dashboard link when available, the original media link or media file path, the thumbnail path when available, the video URL when available, the ad-library link when available, and the short label for where the artifact was discussed in the audit. Preserve every original link or path exactly. If the body of the audit discusses a specific ad, post, hook, creator example, competitor example, or visual source, that source should have an index entry at the bottom so a strategist can reopen it without searching. If no Parker media links or media references were available, write `No Parker media links were available in this run.` Do not invent links, shorten paths, or replace links with descriptions.

This appendix is source infrastructure, not analysis. Do not move open loops into it, and do not count the appendix as a recommendation section. The body of the audit still needs narrative reconstruction of every important visual source; the appendix simply keeps the media handles attached at the bottom.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Including statics. Hook audits cover videos only. Statics belong in a separate static-ad audit.
- Capturing hooks as category labels rather than the exact opening line or frame. "An educational hook about hydration" is not a captured hook. The exact line is.
- Writing hook descriptions as choppy field bullets. Opening line on one line, on-screen text on another, visual hook on a third — that is data, not a description. Write each hook as a flowing paragraph.
- Capping at 2 or 3 examples per source. The standard is 5 to 10 per source. Sample-depth pulls produce sample-depth thinking.
- Running the same affinity and inspo brands every cycle. Competitors stay locked; affinity and inspo rotate so the audit surfaces fresh inspiration each month.
- Including miscategorized or off-brief data with a "flagging this because" caveat. Drop it from the body. Route the data hygiene issue to `data_limitations`.
- Mining promo ads for inspiration. Promo ads can explain a competitor's account behavior, but a coupon code or price drop is not a meaningful hook mechanic for this audit.
- Treating weak ROAS as automatic proof that the hook lost. A hook audit judges the first three seconds by spend plus hook rate. If those are strong, the hook is working and the problem lives later.
- Filtering candidates too early. The job here is breadth. The strategist filters; the audit feeds.
- Reading repeat use of an exact hook by the brand as a winner without capturing the volume. A hook the brand has run twenty times is a different signal than one it has run twice. Capture the count and let the strategist read fatigue from volume.
- Limiting the read to the taxonomy. The taxonomy is a guide. Hooks that do not fit are captured with a new short label, not dropped.
- Treating saturated-hook reads as fatal. A specific hook saturating across competitors is a flag, but a saturated *format* is not — execution and persona angle can still differentiate. Mark exact hooks the field is crowded around so the strategist can route around them.
- Pulling competitor hooks without checking impression rank in the library. High-impression ads inside an ad library are the cheapest proxy for what is actually performing. Lead with those.
- Reading paid creative without the ad-account-analysis method. The hook audit still needs account-reading competence: volume, recency, top placements, repeated variants, absence, and the difference between public-library signal and live spend signal.
- Skipping affinity, inspo, or niche organic because no list was passed in. If the brand-profile is thin on those, infer a starting set and name it as inferred so the brand can confirm or correct.
- Mixing iteration variants on existing hooks into this doc. Iterations live in the iterations log. This doc is for net-new hooks.
- Fabricating impression numbers, usage counts, or test outcomes. A blank beats a guess.
- Including a hook format index table. Format tallies produce tables; tables are not useful in context docs. Call out notable format absences in the pattern-read paragraph at the end of each section instead.
- Including a "candidates to test next" section. That synthesis belongs to the strategist, not the audit. The audit is the field of options; the audit does not converge to a recommendation.
- Writing hook descriptions so thin the reader cannot visualize the shot. The paragraph should read like a small scene, not a label or field list. A reader who cannot watch the video should be able to close their eyes and see it.
- Letting the bolded hook label do the descriptive work. A label is only a handle. The paragraph still has to make the source visible as a small narrative scene.
- Including inspo or affinity hooks featuring creators whose demographic is irrelevant to the brand's buyer. If the brand targets a specific demographic, filter inspo and niche-organic pulls to that demographic at the point of capture. A female-creator hook from an inspo brand is relevant only if the brand has a female-buyer segment it is testing against.
- Writing open loops that are operational housekeeping items — data-pull timeouts, tool-configuration tasks, rotation scheduling. Open loops are questions the hook audit made Parker genuinely curious about: what is not understood yet and why answering it matters for the next cycle. Do not include "what would close it," a research path, or a test plan in this doc. Data-hygiene issues belong in the frontmatter's data_limitations field, not in the open loops.

## Open loops

In open loops, write the few questions the hook audit could not resolve that would actually change what the brand does next. The Parker media links appendix follows open loops as the final section.

<!-- open-loops-core:start — synced from prompts/_open-loops-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.
<!-- open-loops-core:end -->

Doc-specific thinking lens. This audit owns the first three seconds. Its open loops should come from the few things the hook read makes Parker genuinely not understand yet: why one hook, face, format, voice, or source is working; whether a pattern is real or a one-month accident; whether the brand has already tried the thing the audit wants to understand; whether the opening three seconds are the actual bottleneck or something later in the ad is. Individual candidate hooks belong inside the source-specific sections of the audit, not as standalone open loops.

Loops do not cover: data pull failures, tool timeouts, Parker configuration tasks, or affinity-and-inspo rotation scheduling. Those belong in the frontmatter's data_limitations field or in the rotation queue.

Mark only the loops that clearly require proprietary brand input as brand-routed, but do not write a closure plan.

## When you refresh this

Re-run monthly. Take the prior month's hook audit in as context first. Carry forward every captured hook, update usage counts on the brand's own hooks, refresh competitor libraries and re-sort by impression rank, and rotate the affinity, inspo, and niche-organic sources so brands and queries not covered last cycle are covered this cycle. Add any net-new hooks observed, mark any hooks that have died on the feed, and update the strongest source-level hook observations against the current field. Say what each open loop's status is now. Note which affinity and inspo brands are now queued for next cycle.
