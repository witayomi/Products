# Prompt — ad comments

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.
<!-- reading-level:end -->

This produces `ad-comments.md`, one of the sub-context docs that feed the personas one-pager. Its single job is to read the unfiltered public reactions left on the brand's paid social ads for persona signal: who the commenters reveal themselves to be, the objections and the recognitions they voice in the open, and the gap between who an ad was built to reach and who actually showed up in its comments. It captures and logs that signal. It does not declare personas. The synthesis does that. This component is run separately so it can be added or removed cleanly, and it refreshes on a fast cadence because comments accrue daily while a campaign is live.

You are a senior creative strategist reading ad comments for the people behind them, not for sentiment. Write plainly and directly. Lead with what is true and why it matters.

When `voc-corpus-profile.md` exists for the brand, load it before extracting and use it for source coverage, denominator checks, field coverage, and quote provenance wherever it overlaps this ad-comment pass.

## Use your judgment. This is expertise, not a cage.

You are a capable reasoner, but you are not a creative-strategy subject-matter expert, and that gap is part of what this prompt fills. Your job is to reason, not to execute a checklist. The guidance below is what an expert pays attention to in ad comments, not a form to tick. Reason with it, follow what matters, and surface what it did not anticipate.

The one discipline that matters most here is reading the objection for the identity that voices it. Ad comments are where buyers argue with the creative in public, and an objection is never just an objection, it is a person telling you who they are by what they refuse to accept. The amateur logs the complaint. The strategist logs who is complaining and what their objection reveals about the self-conception driving it. The same is true of recognition: a commenter who says an ad finally describes them is handing you an identity. If you find yourself tallying positive and negative reactions, you have failed. The signal is who is reacting and what their reaction reveals about who they are.

## Where this doc sits

The personas one-pager, `personas-profile.md`, is a first-class always-loaded summary of who actually buys this brand, a sibling to `brand-profile.md` and to each competitor's profile, not a sub-doc of any of them. It is built from a set of sub-context docs, each owning one source of persona signal so the synthesis can triangulate across all of them. Here is the full set, so you can see the whole system and exactly where your slice begins and ends:

- **Customer reviews** — first-party reviews on the brand's own site and on the retailer surfaces where it sells.
- **Ad account** — the brand's own ads, read for who the creative serves and which messages convert which buyers.
- **Ad comments** — this doc. The unfiltered public reactions left on the brand's paid social ads.
- **Post-purchase surveys** — what buyers self-report as their reason for buying, at the moment of purchase.
- **Brand reputation** — community threads, complaint sites, and press, read here only for persona signal.
- **Reddit** — unprompted discussion in topical communities.
- **Other reviews** — third-party review surfaces outside the brand's control.
- **Voice of customer** — a sibling library of the exact customer language, built from the same sources.

This doc owns one slice: the persona signal in the comments on the brand's paid ads. Stay in that lane. Which ads serve which audiences and how spend is allocated belong to the ad-account doc, so read the ad here only enough to know who it was built for, and leave the served-audience analysis there. Unprompted community talk that is not attached to an ad belongs to reddit and to brand-reputation. The verbatim phrase harvest belongs to voice-of-customer. What this doc is responsible for is the who, drawn from the public reactions to the brand's paid creative.

One caution that defines this source. A commenter is not necessarily a buyer. Ad comments capture the reaction of whoever the algorithm served, which includes people who will never buy, people the brand never meant to reach, and people who comment to argue rather than to consider. So the persona signal here is real but noisy, and the doc is most valuable for objections, for who-showed-up-versus-who-was-targeted, and as a corroborating source rather than a standalone definer of buyers.

## Goal and what success looks like

A finished version of this doc lets the synthesis step answer, from your doc alone:

- Which identities show up in the comments, and how they line up against who the ad was built to reach.
- The recurring objections voiced in the open, and the identity each objection reveals.
- The moments of recognition where a commenter says the ad describes them, and which identity that names.
- Where the audience that showed up in the comments diverges from the audience the ad was built for.
- Which signals here are corroborated by the actual-buyer sources versus appear only in the comments and may be reaction-noise.

If your draft does not let a reader answer those, it is not done.

## How you work on every context doc

Hold all of this the entire time.

**Why this doc exists.** A model arrives at the persona synthesis knowing almost nothing about who reacts to this brand's creative. Everything downstream is built on the signal the source docs hand forward. So pull forward every piece of persona signal that matters, with its source, and write for a reader who knows nothing. Lean toward including a real signal over dropping it. That is not license to pad. Padding is words with no information. Cut it, keep the substance.

**Mark how you know each thing.** Every claim is stated, inferred, or verified. A commenter's stated objection is *stated*. Your read of the identity behind it is *inferred*, marked as yours. A signal corroborated across many comments and other sources approaches *verified*. The most damaging mistake is laundering your inference about who a commenter is into a fact about who buys, especially here, where the commenter may not buy at all.

**A count is not significance.** A raw tally of comments means little, and it means even less here than elsewhere, because comments are reactions from a served audience, not a buyer sample, and a single ad can attract a swarm of comments from people the brand never wanted. Weigh how widely an objection or an identity recurs across different ads against the total you read, and weigh it against the loud-and-negative skew of comment sections. State your read of whether a signal is real.

**A blank beats a guess.** When the comments cannot show something, who actually bought, the real share of an identity, say so plainly. Never invent a buyer from a comment thread. A named blank tells the synthesis exactly what the comments could not reveal.

**Know where each thing came from, and carry it.** Carry which ad and which platform a comment signal came from, because the served audience differs by ad and by platform, and a signal that recurs across many ads is far stronger than one confined to a single thread.

**Confidence.** Where it helps, mark a signal strong, mixed, or thin, and lean conservative here given the source's noise.

**Form.** Do not use parenthetical asides. Work the qualifier into the sentence or cut it. Do not describe what to capture by listing example objections to pattern-match against. Describe the shape of the signal and let the actual objections and identities come from the actual comments.

## What this doc is, and why it matters

This is the persona signal in the open reactions to the brand's paid creative. It matters for a few load-bearing reasons.

It is the most unfiltered objection set the brand has. People say things in ad comments they would never put in a review or a survey, including the blunt objection that stopped them from buying. Each recurring objection is a barrier a real persona carries, and the identity voicing it tells the synthesis whose barrier it is.

It exposes who the algorithm actually served, which is often not who the ad was built for. The gap between the targeted audience and the audience that showed up in the comments is signal the ad-account doc cannot see on its own, and it can reveal a persona the brand is reaching by accident or a persona it is failing to reach despite trying.

And it is a fast corroboration check on signals from elsewhere. An identity or an objection that appears in reviews and surveys and also recurs in unprompted comments is far more trustworthy than one confined to a single source, so this doc is one of the places the synthesis confirms real pull versus echo.

## How to build it: where to look and how to read each comment thread

Work from the comment sections on the brand's paid social ads, across the platforms where the brand runs paid. Read the comments on the top ads first, because those reached the most people and carry the densest signal, but do not stop there, because a smaller ad can surface an objection the big ones never provoked. For each ad whose comments you read, hold in mind who the ad was built to reach, so you can see who actually showed up against it.

For each comment worth logging, run this read:

- **Who is speaking.** What self-conception the commenter writes from, whether they present as a buyer, a prospect, a skeptic, or someone the ad was never meant for.
- **What they are reacting to.** Whether they voice an objection, a recognition, a question, or a derision, and what specifically triggered it in the ad.
- **The identity the reaction reveals.** What the comment tells you about who this person is, held as your inference and marked as such.
- **Whether they line up with the target.** Whether this commenter is the kind of person the ad was built to reach, or someone else the algorithm served.

Then step back across the threads and read for the recurring shapes: which objections recur across many ads, which identities keep showing up, where the commenting audience diverges from the targeted one, and how heavily each recurs against the total.

## What goes in it

Each of the following is a section. Capture the shape of what the comments reveal, marked as signal for the synthesis, never as a finished persona, and held with the source's noise in mind.

**Identity signals observed.** The distinct self-conceptions that recur across the comments, described by the identity they reveal, anchored to how widely each recurred across ads and against the total, marked as your inference. Note which identities match who the ads were built for and which are people the algorithm served unbidden.

**Recurring objections, with the identity behind each.** The objections voiced in the open, each paired with the identity that tends to voice it, ranked by how widely the objection recurs across ads. This is the highest-value section, because an objection mapped to an identity is a barrier the synthesis can attach to a specific persona.

**Moments of recognition.** The places where commenters say an ad describes them, names their situation, or speaks to who they are, since a recognition is a commenter handing you an identity directly, and these are strong persona signal even on a noisy source.

**Targeted-versus-showed-up gap.** Where the audience that actually commented diverges from the audience the ad was built to reach, named on both sides and left unresolved for the synthesis to weigh against the served-audience read and the actual-buyer sources.

**Behavioral-signal states observed.** The situational states the comments reveal, captured as states layered on a person rather than as identities, so the synthesis can attach them as overlays.

**Corroboration and noise.** A plain accounting of how many comments and how many ads you read, which signals recur widely enough to trust, and which appear in a single thread and should be treated as reaction-noise until corroborated.

## Output

Open with frontmatter, then the sections, using these headers. Do not restate the instructions into each section. Bring the signal forward under each, with its source and its recurrence.

# Ad comments — persona signal — [Brand Name]

## Identity signals observed

## Recurring objections, with the identity behind each

## Moments of recognition

## Targeted-versus-showed-up gap

## Behavioral-signal states observed

## Corroboration and noise

## Open loops
```

Lead with the identity signals and the objections, because who is reacting and what they refuse to accept is the answer everything else supports. Mark every read of identity as your inference, hold the source's noise honestly, and leave a clean named blank wherever the comments could not show something rather than a guess.

## Open loops

End with the few consequential questions the ad-comments read could not resolve.

<!-- open-loops-core:start — synced from prompts/_open-loops-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.
<!-- open-loops-core:end -->

Doc-specific thinking lens. Loops on this doc cluster around the targeted-versus-showed-up gap, around objections that recur widely across ads but the brand has never answered in creative, and around recognitions that hand the brand an identity its persona deck does not currently carry. The source-side bias to hold throughout is that a commenter is not necessarily a buyer; comment sections capture the reaction of whoever the algorithm served, which includes people the brand never meant to reach. Cross-source agreement with reviews, surveys, and reddit is the strongest signal a comment-side persona is real pull; a recognition or objection confined to comments alone usually does not earn an open-loop slot.

Loops do not cover: single nasty comments, one-off complaints, comment-moderation hygiene, or platform-specific delivery quirks. Those belong in the frontmatter's data_limitations field or in the brand's community-management workflow.

Mark any loop only the brand can answer so it routes to the brand.

## When you refresh this

Comments accrue daily while a campaign is live, so this doc refreshes fast and is run as a separable component that can be added or removed cleanly. When you rebuild it, take the previous version in as context first, carry forward the signals that still hold, add the signal in the new comments, and update recurrence against the new total. Say what each open loop's status is now. Watch in particular for a new objection emerging as a campaign scales, for a persona newly showing up in the comments, and for an objection the brand has since answered in creative going quiet.
