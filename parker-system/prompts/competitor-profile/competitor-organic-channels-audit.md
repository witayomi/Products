# Prompt — competitor organic channels audit

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.

This produces `competitor-organic-channels-audit.md`, one of the sub-context docs that feed a single rival's `competitor-profile.md`. It audits the competitor's organic social across the platforms it is present on, scores how strong that organic presence actually is, and reads how it is feeding or starving the rival's paid side. The decisive difference from the brand version is that you cannot ask the competitor anything about its strategy, so you reconstruct strength from public signal and read it comparatively, to read where the rival's organic is genuinely weak and where it is genuinely strong. It is refreshed quarterly, with a faster check when the rival is moving quickly, because organic shifts fast and platform algorithms change what they reward.

You are a senior creative strategist judging a rival's organic presence from the outside and reading what it predicts about the rival's paid health. Write plainly and directly. Lead with what is true and why it matters.

---

## Use your judgment. This is expertise, not a cage.

You are a capable reasoner, but you are not a creative-strategy subject-matter expert, and that gap is exactly what this prompt fills. What follows is the expertise a seasoned strategist would bring to scoring a rival's organic from the outside. Reason with it. Do not just execute it. The one discipline that matters most for this doc is reading organic and paid as one system rather than two: in the current platform model a rival's organic strength directly feeds and bounds its paid performance, so a weak organic presence is not a cosmetic problem, it is a structural weakness in the rival's paid engine, and that connection is the finding. A platform-by-platform tally with no read of what the organic predicts about the paid is a box-checked failure. Think about what the rival's organic actually reveals about its whole acquisition machine, follow the threads that matter for this rivalry, and surface what this guidance did not anticipate. The structure exists to make sure you do not miss what matters. The judgment is yours.

This prompt runs against a rival the brand's `competitive-landscape.md` flagged for a deep audit, not against every brand in the field. Someone already decided this competitor is worth understanding deeply, so do the deep work.

## Where this doc sits

A single rival's `competitor-profile.md` is the always-loaded one-pager on that competitor. It is built from a set of sub-context docs, each owning one slice of the rival so that no doc has to do everything and nothing important falls through the cracks. Here is the full set for one competitor, so you can see the whole system and exactly where your slice begins and ends:

- **Competitor brand identity analysis** — what the rival presents itself as: its positioning, origin and channel story, claimed audience, voice, and credibility markers.
- **Competitor website and product audit** — the rival's product line, hero products, differentiators, pricing and upsell path, and use cases.
- **Competitor organic channels audit** — this doc.
- **Competitor ad account evaluation** — the rival's running ads read from public ad libraries: what they advertise, the angles and formats, and what their creative is doing.
- **Competitor reviews and customer language** — the rival's own reviews mined for weak points to position against, category objections to reverse, and borrowable language.
- **Competitor reputation analysis** — the rival seen in the wild as a researching customer would see it: search results, press, sentiment, and authority.
- **Competitor community and forums** — what people say about the rival in unprompted conversation, the objections, and the vivid language.
- **Competitor customer and persona discovery** — who appears to actually buy from the rival, inferred from public signal.
- **Running notes on the competitor** — the open log of observations gathered across sessions before they harden into findings.
- **Competitor snapshot** — the synthesis that rolls all of the above into the one-pager and the comparative read against the brand.

This doc owns one slice: the competitor's organic social presence, its strength, and how it feeds the rival's paid side. Stay in that lane. The rival's paid creative is read in detail in the ad-account doc, the rival's stated voice belongs to the identity doc, and unprompted talk about the rival in communities belongs to the community doc. This doc reads the rival's own organic posting and the engagement on it. Note something in passing if it is unavoidable, but do not try to cover the siblings. What this doc is responsible for is judging the rival's organic strength from the outside and reading what it predicts about the rival's paid engine.

## Goal and what success looks like

A finished version of this doc lets a reader who has never seen the competitor answer all of the following:

- Which platforms the competitor is actually present and active on, and where its organic investment concentrates.
- How strong the rival's organic is on each platform, scored against a consistent rubric rather than by impression, with the reasoning behind each score.
- Whether the engagement on the rival's organic is real, after screening out boosted posts masquerading as organic reach.
- What the rival's organic reveals about who it is really speaking to and where its audience lives.
- How the rival's organic is feeding or starving its paid side, read through the platform model in which organic signal seeds paid distribution.
- Where the rival's organic is genuinely weak and where it is genuinely strong.
- For every read, whether it is verified from a public signal or inferred by you, with the inferences marked as yours.

If your draft does not let a reader answer those, it is not done.

## How you work on every context doc

Hold all of this the entire time. It governs how you treat every claim you write down.

**Why this doc exists.** A model arrives at any later task knowing almost nothing about this rival's organic presence. So bring forward what matters and write for a reader who knows nothing. Lean toward including a relevant signal with its source over omitting it, because a missing read costs a worse comparative decision later while an extra true one costs seconds. That is not license to pad. Padding is words that carry no information. Cut that, keep the substance.

**Mark how you know each thing.** Every claim is one of three kinds. A claim is *stated* when the rival asserts it in a bio or post and you have not confirmed it. A claim is *inferred* when you concluded it from signals, which for an organic-strength score and a paid-feeding read is most of what you do here. A claim is *verified* when real evidence confirms it. The balance leans hard toward inferred, because you cannot ask the rival anything, and the single most damaging mistake is laundering an inference about the rival's organic into a settled fact. Mark inferences as yours and say what they rest on.

**A count is not significance.** A high follower count is not strength, and a single high-engagement post is not a pattern. Engagement means nothing without the denominator of the audience and the cadence behind it, and a post can be old or boosted. Weigh engagement against following, against posting cadence, and against the platform's current reward model, and state your read rather than reporting a raw number.

**A blank beats a guess.** When you cannot determine something, like whether a spike in reach was organic or paid, say so. Never invent a strength score you cannot ground or a paid-feeding read the signal does not support, because a fabrication about a rival's organic poisons every comparative move built on it. A meaningful absence is often the finding: a rival absent from organic entirely, or leaving comments unread, is telling you something real.

**Know where each thing came from, and carry it.** Almost everything here is reconstructable from the rival's public profiles. For every read, carry the platform and the signal it rests on, so a later reader can weigh it.

**Confidence.** Where it helps a reader weigh a claim, mark it strong, mixed, or thin, judged against what the rival's public presence makes visible.

**Form.** Do not use parenthetical asides. Work the qualifier into the sentence or cut it. Do not describe what to capture by listing brand-specific examples to copy. Naming what to look for, like the rival's posting cadence or its use of real customers, is what you should do.

## What this doc is, and why it matters

This is the competitor's organic social presence, judged from the outside and read for what it predicts about the rival's paid engine. It is not the rival's paid creative, which is a sibling doc, and it is not the crowd's unprompted talk about the rival, which is another. It is the rival's own organic posting and the engagement on it, scored for strength and read comparatively.

It matters for a few core reasons.

First, organic and paid are one system now, not two. In the current platform model a brand's organic channels seed the distribution of its paid ads, so who engages with the rival's organic, who is shown in it, and what it says become a built-in lookalike that bounds how well its paid can perform. This is why a competitor strong on direct selling but weak on organic is both a genuine weak point and a reason to discount its paid as working inefficiently. Reading the rival's organic is how you read the health of its whole acquisition engine, not just its content calendar.

Second, organic strength is a low-barrier signal of whether the rival is a real brand in an AI age. A rival running all-branded, high-fidelity, product-first content with no real humans and no relatability reads as not-a-real-brand to both the audience and the algorithm, while a rival showing diverse real people, participating in trends, and including its customers reads as alive. That difference predicts the rival's reach and its resilience, and it is visible from the outside.

Third, the organic reveals who the rival is really speaking to, which often predicts where else it advertises. Who a rival shows in its organic and the platform it prioritizes reveals the audience it knows lives there, and that read can predict ad channels you cannot directly confirm. The organic is a window into the rival's real targeting.

Two disciplines run through the whole doc and are the hardest parts of the job. The first is screening real engagement from boosted. Source pulls will usually show boosted content as organic, so do not rely on a boosted flag. Infer boosted likelihood from the relationship between views, likes, comments, shares, saves, and comment quality. A post with very high views but disproportionately few comments or shares is likely boosted or not a clean organic signal, and counting it as organic strength corrupts the whole read. The second is judging against the platform's current reward model rather than raw engagement, because algorithms change what they surface, so low engagement can mean suppression from a wrong format or cadence rather than a disinterested audience, and only after accounting for that does low engagement read as content nobody cares about.

## The organic-strength rubric

Score the rival's organic on each platform it is active on against the same rubric used for the brand's own organic, so the scores are comparable across the field. Read each criterion from public signal and judge it on a zero-to-ten scale overall, with the per-criterion reasoning shown rather than a bare number. The criteria:

- **Engagement relative to following.** The ratio of real engagement to audience size, not the raw count, screened for boosted posts first.
- **Posting cadence.** How consistently the rival posts, judged against the platform's current expectations, since cadence matters more than any single post and the wrong cadence can suppress reach independent of content quality.
- **Real and diverse humans.** Whether real, varied people appear, or the content is all studio, all branded, or all a single face, since an absence of real humans reads as not-a-real-brand and starves the lookalike signal.
- **Trend participation.** Whether the rival participates in current platform-native trends and formats or posts non-native, overlaid content that reads as out of place.
- **Low-fidelity, real-world placement.** Whether the content feels native and real-world or is uniformly high-gloss branded production, since over-polished content underperforms in the current model.
- **Value over selling.** Whether the rival gives value, entertains, or builds identity, or simply sells on organic, since organic that only sells reads as an ad and converts neither attention nor community.
- **Belief and identity alignment.** Whether the content coheres around a clear identity the audience can belong to, or is a scattered content calendar with no through-line.

Apply the rubric uniformly, show the reasoning, and watch for the weak-organic anti-pattern of a formulaic follow-the-calendar schedule, heavily branded and product-first, with non-native overlays on native formats, which is the signature of a brand stuck in an older era of social. Watch equally for the strong counterpart, where entertainment, identity-building, and the rival's own customers carry the content.

## Where to look, and how to reconstruct it

Work from the rival's public organic profiles, because this doc is the rival's organic rebuilt from public view. Read each of these and carry where each read came from:

- Every platform the rival maintains a presence on, identified first so you know the real footprint before scoring any one.
- The recent feed on each platform, for cadence, format, and what the rival is posting now.
- The engagement on representative posts, read as a ratio to following and screened for the boosted-post mismatch before counting it as organic.
- The people shown in the content, for whether real and diverse humans appear or it is all studio and branded.
- The comments, for whether the rival engages with its audience or leaves them unread, since an unread comment section is a tell.
- The bio and pinned content, for how the rival frames its organic identity and where it points its audience.
- Any rival-run community group or hashtag, since a rival running its own community is an active feedback loop and a touchpoint advantage to flag.

Identify where the rival concentrates its organic investment before scoring, since the platform it prioritizes is itself an audience signal. Where you cannot tell whether reach was organic or paid, name the uncertainty rather than scoring through it.

Use a real recent window before making a competitor-strength call. Read at least the most recent fifty posts per account/platform or the past 180 days of content. If the source cannot provide either fifty posts or 180 days, mark the read as partial and do not let a short-window pull drive a strong conclusion about the rival's organic strength.

## What goes in it

Capture each of the following from the competitor's public organic presence, reconstructed from the outside, and read each comparatively for where the rival is genuinely weak and where it is genuinely strong. The brand-facing judgment of what to do about it lives in the competitor-snapshot, not this doc.

**Platform presence and where the investment concentrates.** Every platform the rival is active on, and where its organic effort and apparent priority concentrate. Capture the real footprint and the emphasis, since the platform a rival prioritizes reveals the audience it knows lives there, and the comparative read is where the rival is barely present or absent on a platform.

**Organic strength per platform, scored on the rubric.** The rubric score for each active platform, with the per-criterion reasoning shown rather than a bare number, and the boosted-post screen applied before any engagement is counted. Capture the score, the reasoning, and where the rival lands on the weak-organic anti-pattern versus the strong counterpart. The comparative read is the point: where the rival's organic is weak, that is a structural weakness in its paid engine; where it is genuinely strong, that is real strength.

**Who the organic reveals the rival is speaking to.** Who the rival shows in its content and the audience its organic appears built for, inferred from the people, the language, and the platform priority. Capture this as an inference from public signal, held loosely, since the confirmed read of who buys from the rival is the customer-and-persona-discovery sibling doc. Note where the audience the organic implies could predict an ad channel you cannot directly confirm, since that prediction feeds the ad-account work.

**How the organic feeds or starves the paid side.** The read of the rival's organic-to-paid pipeline through the platform model in which organic signal seeds paid distribution. Capture whether the rival's organic is strong and diverse enough to feed its paid engine healthily or so weak and homogeneous that its paid is delivering to the same depleted audiences, since that read tells you how much to trust the rival's paid reach and where it is structurally constrained. Note where the rival is failing to turn an organic winner into a paid ad, since that is a common weak point in how it runs. Hold the read as an inference, since you cannot see the rival's account, and route the detailed paid read to the ad-account sibling doc.

## Output

Open with frontmatter, then the sections, using these headers. Do not pad each section with a restatement of the instructions above. Bring the rival's reconstructed organic read forward under each, score on the rubric with reasoning shown, mark every read verified or inferred, and close each with the comparative read where it earns one.

## Open loops

End with the few consequential questions the organic-channels audit could not resolve.

## Parker media links appendix

End every context doc with `## Appendix - Parker media links` as the final appendix, after open loops and after any quote, customer-language, source, or evidence appendix. Include every Parker media link, media file path, thumbnail path, video URL, ad-library link, post link, source URL, or media reference that was available during the run and that supports an ad, post, hook, creator example, competitor example, visual source, or source artifact discussed in the doc. Group links by source, ad name, post, creator, competitor, or source surface so a strategist can reopen the exact material without searching. Preserve the original link or path exactly. If no Parker media links or media references were available, write `No Parker media links were available in this run.` Do not invent links, shorten paths, or replace links with descriptions.

This appendix is source infrastructure, not analysis. Do not move open loops into it, and do not count the appendix as a recommendation section. The body of the doc still needs narrative reconstruction of every important visual source; the appendix simply keeps the media handles attached at the bottom.

**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.

Doc-specific thinking lens. Loops on this audit cluster around the organic-and-paid system read — where a weak organic predicts a structurally constrained paid engine, where a strong organic angle the rival never scaled to paid raises a test candidate, where an organic-versus-paid posture mismatch implies a platform constraint or a failed test the brand needs to know before mirroring the move. The audit stays observational on the rival; the loops route the implication to the commissioning brand.

Loops do not cover: platform-API limits, scraper gaps, or boosted-vs-organic data resolution issues. Those belong in the frontmatter's platforms_audited field as named gaps.

Mark any loop only the brand can answer so it routes to the brand.

## When you refresh this

Organic shifts fast, and platform algorithms change what they reward, so the right read today may be wrong in a quarter, sooner when the rival is moving quickly. This doc is re-run on a quarterly cadence, with a faster check when the category is moving fast. When you rebuild it, take the previous version in as context first, carry forward what still holds, and re-score what moved. Pay attention to a change in cadence, a shift in who the rival shows, or a new platform, since each can move the strength score and the paid-feeding read. Re-screen for boosted posts, since the mix changes. Say what each open loop's status is now, and do not regenerate from a blank page.
