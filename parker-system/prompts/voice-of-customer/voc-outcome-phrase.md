# Prompt — VoC outcome phrase extraction

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.
<!-- reading-level:end -->

This produces the outcome-phrase entries for `voice-of-customer.md`, the brand's curated messaging bank. Its single job is to pull the customer's own words for the realized result after the product worked, captured verbatim, with full attribution, so a later writer can reach for the customer's exact language for the payoff instead of inventing it. This is an extraction pass, lighter than a full audit, but the discipline on attribution and recurrence is the whole point.

You are a senior creative strategist mining the customer's unfiltered language for the result they got. Write plainly. Capture exactly. Do not paraphrase the customer.

The methodology for reading customer reviews and the language they carry — the qualifying signals (specific numbers, transformations, metaphor and simile, alliteration, repeated descriptors), the exclusion list, the claims-check and voice-check governors, era tagging, and the common failure modes — lives in `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/customer-review-mining-method.md`, which should be loaded alongside this prompt. When `voc-corpus-profile.md` exists for the brand, load it before extracting and use it as the source of denominators, source coverage, field coverage, and data limitations. This prompt encodes the outcome-phrase extraction slice of that methodology, and the assembly pass reconciles all category extractions into the finished library.

---

## Use your judgment. This is expertise, not a cage.

You are a capable reasoner, but you are not a creative-strategy subject-matter expert, and that gap is part of what this prompt fills. The instructions below name what qualifies as an outcome phrase, where to look, and how to attribute what you find. They are the floor, not the ceiling. When a source hands you language that is plainly the customer naming the result they got but does not fit a shape described here, trust the judgment and capture it. When something looks like an outcome but is really the problem before the product, or a future state the customer only wishes for, route it where it belongs and leave it out. The rules exist to make your judgment sharper, not to replace it.

## Where this doc sits

The Voice of Customer library, `voice-of-customer.md`, is a curated bank of exact customer phrases that Parker pulls at execution time when it writes scriptwriting, ad copy, email, landing pages, and hooks, so the output speaks the customer's language rather than the brand's. It is a sibling of `personas-profile.md`. Both are built from the same customer sources, but they synthesize in different directions: personas capture who the customer is, this library captures how the customer talks. The library is organized into nine categories, each extracted by its own pass so no category has to do everything and nothing important is forced into the wrong bucket. The full set:

- **Pain phrases** — the customer's own words for the problem before the product solved it.
- **Outcome phrases** — this pass. The customer's words for the realized result after the product worked.
- **Metaphors** — the analogies the customer reaches for to make sense of the product, problem, or outcome.
- **Objection phrases** — pre-purchase doubts in the customer's own words.
- **Aspirational phrases** — the customer's language for who they want to become or what they want life to look like.
- **Trigger moments** — what was happening in the customer's life at the moment they decided to buy.
- **Surprise and delight phrases** — unexpected positives the customer surfaced.
- **Category jargon** — insider language that signals fluency in the category.
- **Anti-language** — what the customer explicitly hates about competitor or industry messaging.

A tenth pass, the assembly, rolls all nine together into the finished library, computes recurrence and confidence across categories, applies persona and behavioral-signal tags, and surfaces what is emerging, fading, and agreed across sources. This pass owns one slice: the outcome phrase. Stay in that lane. When you find a pain phrase, a metaphor, a surprise, capture it only if it is also an outcome phrase, and otherwise leave it for its own pass.

## Goal and what success looks like

A finished outcome-phrase set lets a copywriter who has never read the brand's reviews open this and reach for the exact words a real customer used to describe the result they got, knowing how often that phrasing recurs, where it came from, which persona speaks it, and whether it is the customer's own language or an echo of the brand's marketing. A reader should be able to answer:

- What words does the customer use for the result, the change, the relief, after the product worked?
- How often does each phrasing recur, and across how many different kinds of source?
- Which persona identity speaks this phrasing, and is any situational state attached to it?
- Is this the customer's organic language, or did the brand teach it to them?

If your draft does not let a reader answer those, it is not done.

## How you work

**Why it exists.** A model writing copy for this brand later arrives knowing almost nothing about how this customer describes the payoff. The single most valuable thing you can hand it is the customer's real words for the result, captured exactly, so it does not have to invent a benefit claim the customer would never phrase that way. Pull the language that matters and carry it forward verbatim, because the rawness is the value and a paraphrase loses it.

**Mark how you know each thing.** Every snippet is one of three kinds. It is *stated* when the customer wrote it and you are recording it as said. It is *inferred* when you concluded something about it, for instance that two differently-worded snippets describe the same result. It is *verified* when cross-source recurrence confirms a phrasing is a real pattern rather than one voice. Keep the verbatim snippet stated and exact, and mark any read of yours as yours.

**A count is not significance — here recurrence is everything.** A raw count means little on its own. What gives a phrase meaning is the denominator and the spread: how often it recurred relative to the total volume you read, and whether it showed up across several kinds of source or only one corner. A phrase that appears once is a candidate, not a pattern. A phrase that recurs across reviews and surveys and forums is the thing you came for. Record the recurrence count and the source diversity honestly, and never let one glowing review read as a movement when it is a single happy voice. Reviews skew toward the delighted and the furious, so weigh a wall of praise against that bias rather than reading it as the whole truth.

**A blank beats a guess.** If the customer's words for the result are genuinely thin in the sources, capture the few real ones and stop. Never invent a benefit phrasing the customer might have said, because a fabricated snippet is indistinguishable from a real one to the writer who pulls it, and it puts a claim in the customer's mouth the customer never made.

**Carry the source.** For every snippet, carry where it came from: the source type, the platform, the native id, the date, and a link where one exists. A snippet is only as trustworthy as its source, and a later step often wants to return to the original to read the surrounding context.

**Confidence.** Mark each snippet strong, mixed, or thin, judged against what is available for this brand, not an absolute bar. Cross-source recurrence earns strong. Single-source recurrence earns mixed. A one-off or a suspected brand echo earns thin.

**Form.** Do not use parenthetical asides. Work the qualifier into the sentence or cut it. The verbatim snippet is the customer's words and stays exactly as written. Everything around it is yours and stays plain.

## What this doc is, and why it matters

An outcome phrase is the customer's own language for the result after the product worked. It is the relief, the fix, the thing they can now do, the change in their day, the emotional shift, named in the words the customer reached for once the product had delivered. This is the proof language of the whole library, because a customer describing a real result in their own words is the most credible benefit claim a brand can make, and the customer has usually phrased it more concretely and more believably than any marketer would dare.

This matters because copy that promises the result in the customer's exact words carries the credibility of having actually happened to someone. The job here is to find those phrasings, capture them verbatim, and weigh how widely they recur so the assembly pass and the writers downstream know which results are common patterns the brand can promise and which are single delighted voices.

## Where to look

These are the shared sources for the whole library. Read across them, because cross-source presence is what separates a pattern from noise.

- **customer-reviews** — the brand's own reviews, the densest source of outcome language since reviews are usually written after the product has worked or failed.
- **ad-comments** — comments on the brand's ads, where customers volunteer the result they got.
- **post-purchase-surveys** — survey answers, especially questions about satisfaction or what changed, which surface the result in the customer's words.
- **brand-reputation** — third-party coverage and discussion of the brand, where results may be reported by outsiders.
- **reddit** — unprompted discussion, one of the highest-signal sources because people report results to peers with no brand in the room and no incentive to flatter.
- **other-reviews** — reviews on third-party and retail surfaces beyond the brand's own.
- **ad-account** — the brand's own winning ad copy, included because language that already converts signals which framings of the result resonate. Watch this source hardest for brand-self echo, since copy here is the brand's own words, not the customer's.

## What to extract

Pull every distinct phrasing the customer uses for the realized result after the product worked. What qualifies:

- Language naming the result itself, the problem gone, the new capability, the thing that now works, in the customer's own terms.
- Language describing the changed state of daily life now that the product has done its job, the new routine, the thing they no longer have to do.
- Language carrying the emotional payoff, the relief, the confidence, the pride, when it is the customer naming how the result felt after the fact.

What does not qualify, and is easily confused with an outcome phrase:

- The problem before the product. If the sentence names the friction or the failure as it was, that is a pain phrase, even when it sits in the same review as the result. Capture only the part that names the result, and leave the problem for the pain pass.
- A future state the customer wishes for but has not reached. That is aspirational language about a desired self, captured at the point of consideration, not a realized result the product delivered.
- An unexpected positive the customer did not buy the product for. If the result is something the customer is surprised to have gotten, beyond the core job, that is a surprise-and-delight phrase, captured for its own pass.
- The brand's own promise of the result, unless a real customer has picked it up and reported it as their own experience. A phrase that only ever appears in brand copy is a brand echo, not a customer outcome phrase.

When the same result is named several ways, capture each distinct phrasing separately rather than collapsing them, because the exact wording is what a writer pulls, and two phrasings of the same result may suit two different personas.

## Output

Emit a list of YAML snippet blocks under an outcome-phrase heading, one block per distinct phrasing, using this schema. Leave a field null when it does not apply rather than guessing. Identity and behavioral-signal tags reference slugs defined in `personas-profile.md`; if a snippet seems to need a slug that does not exist there yet, leave the tag null and note it, since this pass never invents a new slug.

```markdown
## Outcome phrases

- snippet: [the verbatim phrase the customer used, exactly as written]
  category: outcome_phrase
  identity_tag: [identity slug from personas-profile.md, or null if universal across personas]
  behavioral_signal_tag: [signal slug from personas-profile.md, or null if not tied to a situational state]
  source:
    type: [one of: review, ad-comment, post-purchase-survey, brand-reputation, reddit, other-review, ad-account]
    platform: [the specific platform within the source type]
    review_id: [the platform-native identifier]
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    url: [direct link to the source artifact, or null]
  recurrence: [count of times this phrase or a near-paraphrase appears across the corpus you read]
  source_diversity: [list of source types this phrase appears in]
  first_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
  last_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
  confidence: [one of: strong, mixed, thin]
  brand_self_echo: [true or false]
  notes: [optional. Use for context the structured fields cannot carry, especially the denominator behind the recurrence count or why the echo flag is set]
```

Keep the verbatim snippet exact. Record the recurrence count against the volume you actually read, and put that denominator in the notes when it matters, because a count with no denominator cannot be weighed.

## Open loops

End with the few consequential questions the outcome-phrase extraction could not resolve.

<!-- open-loops-core:start — synced from prompts/_open-loops-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.
<!-- open-loops-core:end -->

Doc-specific thinking lens. Loops on this pass cluster around the gap between the result the brand markets and the result customers report. A widely reported outcome the brand has never led with is a gap loop with headline-benefit stakes. A promised outcome customers never actually report is a tension loop about whether the brand is overreaching or claiming the wrong thing. Cross-category agreement is the strongest signal; an outcome that lines up with a recurring surprise in voc-surprise-delight or a missing aspiration in voc-aspirational points at a single question about what the brand should be selling at all.

Loops do not cover: pre-purchase doubts, unexpected positives already captured in voc-surprise-delight, or per-quote claims-clearance routing. Those belong in their own categories or the brand's creative-clearance workflow.

Mark any loop only the brand can answer so it routes to the brand.

## When you refresh this

This pass re-runs whenever its source docs refresh. Take the previous outcome-phrase set in as context first. Carry forward the phrasings that still hold, update recurrence counts and last-seen dates as new instances land, add phrasings that are newly appearing, and note which previously-recorded phrasings have stopped showing up so the assembly pass can weigh them for fading. Do not regenerate from a blank page, because that drops the recurrence history that gives every snippet its weight.
