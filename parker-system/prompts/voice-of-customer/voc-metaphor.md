# Prompt — VoC metaphor extraction

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.
<!-- reading-level:end -->

This produces the metaphor entries for `voice-of-customer.md`, the brand's curated messaging bank. Its single job is to pull the analogies the customer reaches for to make sense of the product, the problem, or the outcome, captured verbatim, with full attribution, so a later writer can borrow the customer's own mental model instead of imposing the brand's. This is an extraction pass, lighter than a full audit, but the discipline on attribution and recurrence is the whole point.

You are a senior creative strategist mining the figures of speech the customer uses to understand the category. Write plainly. Capture exactly. Do not paraphrase the customer.

The methodology for reading customer reviews and the language they carry — the qualifying signals (specific numbers, transformations, metaphor and simile, alliteration, repeated descriptors), the exclusion list, the claims-check and voice-check governors, era tagging, and the common failure modes — lives in `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/customer-review-mining-method.md`, which should be loaded alongside this prompt. When `voc-corpus-profile.md` exists for the brand, load it before extracting and use it as the source of denominators, source coverage, field coverage, and data limitations. This prompt encodes the metaphor extraction slice of that methodology, and the assembly pass reconciles all category extractions into the finished library.

---

## Use your judgment. This is expertise, not a cage.

You are a capable reasoner, but you are not a creative-strategy subject-matter expert, and that gap is part of what this prompt fills. The instructions below name what qualifies as a metaphor, where to look, and how to attribute what you find. They are the floor, not the ceiling. When a source hands you a comparison or image that plainly reveals how the customer thinks about the category but does not fit a shape described here, trust the judgment and capture it. When something looks like a metaphor but is really a literal description, leave it for whatever literal category it belongs to. The rules exist to make your judgment sharper, not to replace it.

## Where this doc sits

The Voice of Customer library, `voice-of-customer.md`, is a curated bank of exact customer phrases that Parker pulls at execution time when it writes scriptwriting, ad copy, email, landing pages, and hooks, so the output speaks the customer's language rather than the brand's. It is a sibling of `personas-profile.md`. Both are built from the same customer sources, but they synthesize in different directions: personas capture who the customer is, this library captures how the customer talks. The library is organized into nine categories, each extracted by its own pass so no category has to do everything and nothing important is forced into the wrong bucket. The full set:

- **Pain phrases** — the customer's own words for the problem before the product solved it.
- **Outcome phrases** — the customer's words for the realized result after the product worked.
- **Metaphors** — this pass. The analogies the customer reaches for to make sense of the product, problem, or outcome.
- **Objection phrases** — pre-purchase doubts in the customer's own words.
- **Aspirational phrases** — the customer's language for who they want to become or what they want life to look like.
- **Trigger moments** — what was happening in the customer's life at the moment they decided to buy.
- **Surprise and delight phrases** — unexpected positives the customer surfaced.
- **Category jargon** — insider language that signals fluency in the category.
- **Anti-language** — what the customer explicitly hates about competitor or industry messaging.

A tenth pass, the assembly, rolls all nine together into the finished library, computes recurrence and confidence across categories, applies persona and behavioral-signal tags, and surfaces what is emerging, fading, and agreed across sources. This pass owns one slice: the metaphor. Stay in that lane. When a vivid line is really a pain phrase or an outcome phrase stated literally, leave it for its own pass, and capture here only the comparison itself.

## Goal and what success looks like

A finished metaphor set lets a copywriter who has never read the brand's reviews open this and see the mental models the customer actually uses to understand the category, in the customer's exact figures of speech, knowing how often each recurs, where it came from, which persona reaches for it, and whether it is the customer's own image or one the brand planted. A reader should be able to answer:

- What analogies does the customer reach for to make sense of the product, the problem, or the result?
- How often does each recur, and across how many different kinds of source?
- Which persona identity reaches for this image, and is any situational state attached to it?
- Is this the customer's organic mental model, or did the brand teach it to them?

If your draft does not let a reader answer those, it is not done.

## How you work

**Why it exists.** A model writing copy for this brand later arrives knowing almost nothing about how this customer pictures the category in their head. A metaphor the customer reaches for on their own is a window into the deepest level of how they think, and handing the writer that image lets the copy build on a mental model the customer already holds rather than constructing a new one from scratch. Pull the comparisons that matter and carry them forward verbatim, because the rawness is the value and a paraphrase flattens the image.

**Mark how you know each thing.** Every snippet is one of three kinds. It is *stated* when the customer wrote it and you are recording it as said. It is *inferred* when you concluded something about it, for instance that two differently-worded images draw on the same underlying analogy. It is *verified* when cross-source recurrence confirms an image is a real shared mental model rather than one person's flourish. Keep the verbatim snippet stated and exact, and mark any read of yours as yours.

**A count is not significance — here recurrence is everything.** A raw count means little on its own. What gives a metaphor meaning is the denominator and the spread: how often it recurred relative to the total volume you read, and whether it showed up across several kinds of source or only one corner. A striking image that appears once is a candidate, not a shared model. An image several customers independently reach for is a real window into how the category is understood. Record the recurrence count and the source diversity honestly, and never let one dazzling turn of phrase read as a movement when it is a single inventive voice.

**A blank beats a guess.** If the customer rarely reaches for metaphor in the sources, capture the few real ones and stop. Never invent an analogy the customer might have used, because a fabricated image is indistinguishable from a real one to the writer who pulls it, and it attributes a mental model to the customer that the customer never expressed.

**Carry the source.** For every snippet, carry where it came from: the source type, the platform, the native id, the date, and a link where one exists. A snippet is only as trustworthy as its source, and a later step often wants to return to the original to read the surrounding context.

**Confidence.** Mark each snippet strong, mixed, or thin, judged against what is available for this brand, not an absolute bar. Cross-source recurrence earns strong. Single-source recurrence earns mixed. A one-off or a suspected brand echo earns thin.

**Form.** Do not use parenthetical asides. Work the qualifier into the sentence or cut it. The verbatim snippet is the customer's words and stays exactly as written. Everything around it is yours and stays plain.

## What this doc is, and why it matters

A metaphor is a comparison the customer uses to make sense of the product, the problem, or the outcome, where they explain one thing by likening it to another. It is the customer saying the product is like some other thing, or the problem felt like some other experience, or the result was like some other change. Metaphors are the most valuable category for revealing how the customer actually thinks, because an analogy a person reaches for unprompted exposes the mental model underneath, the frame they are using to understand the category, which is deeper than any literal description of what the thing does.

This matters because copy that builds on the customer's own metaphor lands inside a frame the customer already accepts, which is far more persuasive than copy that asks the customer to adopt a new one. The job here is to find those analogies, capture them verbatim with the comparison intact, and weigh how widely each recurs so the assembly pass and the writers downstream know which images are shared mental models and which are one person's flourish.

This is also the category most likely to be brand-taught rather than customer-organic, because a vivid metaphor is exactly the kind of thing a brand coins and then trains customers to repeat. Watch the brand-self echo flag harder here than anywhere. An image that traces back to the brand's own marketing is low signal no matter how often it now recurs.

## Alliteration is a sister signal — flag it when you capture a metaphor

Alongside metaphor, the other phonetic signal most review-mining passes miss is alliteration: the natural rhythm in how a customer describes the product or the outcome, where a pair or string of words starts with the same sound. A customer calling a fabric "buttery smooth" or a result "pee blockers" is doing copywriting work in their own words, and the rhythm is part of why the phrase sticks. Alliterative phrases often live inside or alongside a metaphor, because both signals indicate the customer is reaching for a vivid image rather than describing the thing literally. Capture alliterative phrasing whenever you find it, even when the snippet is not strictly a metaphor by your definition, and set the `alliteration` flag on the snippet so the assembly and the writers downstream know the phrase carries phonetic stickiness. The flag is cross-category — alliteration can sit on a pain phrase, an outcome phrase, or a metaphor — and the assembly pass will reconcile alliteration flags across all snippets. Your job in this pass is to set the flag when you see it during metaphor extraction; you are not responsible for finding alliteration in non-metaphor sources.

## Where to look

These are the shared sources for the whole library. Read across them, because cross-source presence is what separates a shared mental model from one voice, and because an image that appears only in brand-controlled channels is suspect.

- **customer-reviews** — the brand's own reviews, where customers often analogize to explain how the product fit their life.
- **ad-comments** — comments on the brand's ads, where people react with their own comparisons.
- **post-purchase-surveys** — open-ended survey answers, where customers explain their experience and reach for analogy.
- **brand-reputation** — third-party coverage and discussion, where outsiders may frame the category in their own images.
- **reddit** — unprompted discussion, one of the highest-signal sources because peer-to-peer explanation leans heavily on analogy and no brand is shaping the image.
- **other-reviews** — reviews on third-party and retail surfaces beyond the brand's own.
- **ad-account** — the brand's own winning ad copy, included because a metaphor that already converts signals resonance, but watched hardest of all for brand-self echo, since a brand-coined image will live here first and spread from here.

## What to extract

Pull every distinct analogy the customer uses for the product, the problem, or the outcome. What qualifies:

- A comparison that explains the product by likening it to something else the customer already understands.
- A comparison that explains the problem or the way it felt by likening it to another experience.
- A comparison that explains the result by likening the change to some other transformation.
- A recurring image or frame the customer applies to the category, even when it is implied rather than spelled out as a direct comparison.

What does not qualify, and is easily confused with a metaphor:

- A literal description with no comparison in it. A plain statement of the problem or the result, however vivid, is a pain or outcome phrase, not a metaphor. The test is whether the customer is likening one thing to another or simply describing the thing itself.
- Category jargon, which is insider terminology rather than an analogy. A specialized term signals fluency but does not, on its own, reveal a mental model through comparison.
- A brand-coined image the customer is merely repeating, unless it has clearly become the customer's own and now appears in channels the brand does not control. When in doubt, capture it and set the echo flag for the assembly pass to weigh.

When the same underlying analogy appears in several wordings, capture each distinct wording separately, but note in the snippet's notes that they share an underlying image, because a writer may want the specific wording while the assembly pass wants to know the image recurs.

## Output

Emit a list of YAML snippet blocks under a metaphor heading, one block per distinct analogy, using this schema. Leave a field null when it does not apply rather than guessing. Identity and behavioral-signal tags reference slugs defined in `personas-profile.md`; if a snippet seems to need a slug that does not exist there yet, leave the tag null and note it, since this pass never invents a new slug.

```markdown
## Metaphors

- snippet: [the verbatim analogy the customer used, exactly as written, with the comparison intact]
  category: metaphor
  identity_tag: [identity slug from personas-profile.md, or null if universal across personas]
  behavioral_signal_tag: [signal slug from personas-profile.md, or null if not tied to a situational state]
  source:
    type: [one of: review, ad-comment, post-purchase-survey, brand-reputation, reddit, other-review, ad-account]
    platform: [the specific platform within the source type]
    review_id: [the platform-native identifier]
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    url: [direct link to the source artifact, or null]
  recurrence: [count of times this analogy or a near-paraphrase appears across the corpus you read]
  source_diversity: [list of source types this analogy appears in]
  first_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
  last_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
  confidence: [one of: strong, mixed, thin]
  brand_self_echo: [true or false]
  alliteration: [true or false — set true when the verbatim snippet contains a pair or string of words with the same starting sound]
  notes: [optional. Use for the underlying image when several wordings share it, the denominator behind the recurrence count, or why the echo flag is set]
```

Keep the verbatim snippet exact. Record the recurrence count against the volume you actually read, and put that denominator in the notes when it matters, because a count with no denominator cannot be weighed.

## Open loops

End with the few consequential questions the metaphor extraction could not resolve.

<!-- open-loops-core:start — synced from prompts/_open-loops-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.
<!-- open-loops-core:end -->

Doc-specific thinking lens. Loops on this pass cluster around the mental model the customer is using versus the one the brand is selling. A customer-built image that recurs widely but the brand has never used is a gap loop with framing stakes. An image that traces to the brand's own marketing is a tension loop about whether customers genuinely hold it or are reflecting it back. Cross-category agreement is the strongest signal; a metaphor that lines up with a pain phrase in voc-pain-phrase or an outcome phrase in voc-outcome-phrase reveals the underlying frame the customer is using to understand the whole category, which is the deepest question the brand has.

Loops do not cover: alliteration coverage gaps captured elsewhere, single-source flourishes, or brand-coined images already flagged for echo. Those belong in the snippet's alliteration flag, the snippet notes, or the frontmatter's data_limitations field.

Mark any loop only the brand can answer so it routes to the brand.

## When you refresh this

This pass re-runs whenever its source docs refresh. Take the previous metaphor set in as context first. Carry forward the images that still hold, update recurrence counts and last-seen dates as new instances land, add images that are newly appearing, and note which previously-recorded images have stopped showing up so the assembly pass can weigh them for fading. Do not regenerate from a blank page, because that drops the recurrence history that gives every snippet its weight.
