# Prompt — competitive landscape

<!-- expertise-core:start — synced from prompts/_expertise-core-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py -->
**The expertise layer — load it before you analyze.** This prompt's process tells you what to produce. The creative-strategy-context docs tell you how a strategist thinks while producing it, and they are mandatory reads, not references. Before starting the analysis, open `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` in this prompt tree, load every doc it names for this doc type, and load the brand lens overlay (`brand-lens.md`) afterward if one exists. The brand lens is where this brand's own tribal knowledge lives — what the team has told us, what has worked and failed for them, the do's and don'ts and overrides that a general method can't know. When the lens and a general method disagree, the lens wins, because it is this brand speaking. Treat anything the brand has stated or hand-corrected as authoritative over the generic rule. Perform the analysis *through* those methods: their named concepts, their taxonomies, their bar for what good looks like, their vocabulary. The test is unforgiving — an analysis that never speaks the loaded methods' language proves they were not read, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

**Show the reasoning, not just the mark.** Every consequential claim carries its evidence walk in prose: what you examined, what you found there, and why the claim earns its mark — verified, inferred, or stated. A bare "verified" is not enough; the reader is a creative strategist who must retell this finding to other people and defend it, so give them the story that makes it believable and usable. Ground findings in concrete examples — the specific ad described richly enough to replay, the exact verbatim with its source and date, the number with its denominator and window. Specificity is the difference between an insight and an assertion.

**Tell the research story and carry the evidence picture.** Assume this output may be the only context another LLM or strategist reads before making a creative-strategy decision. Give them the source-level audit trail: what you reviewed, how you sliced it, which windows, counts, and surfaces mattered, what data was missing, what pattern emerged, and how you got from evidence to conclusion. Then, inside every major read, give the evidence picture for that claim: the scope behind it, the shape of the pattern, how representative the signal appears, and the concrete examples that made the read earn its place. This is not private chain of thought. It is the visible research trail a skeptical reader needs in order to trust the answer.

**Full media analysis or no creative claim.** When a claim touches an ad, post, hook, creator, competitor creative, format, persona, product focus, proof role, visual source, or any read of who appears in creative and what the creative means, the evidence must come from full media or source analysis, not metadata. Full media analysis means source fields that describe what the viewer sees and hears: Parker MCP creative overview, creative description, visual hook, text hook, verbal hook, creator demographic, ad summary, ad analysis, transcript, script, storyboard, static image, thumbnail, playable media URL, landing page, AI tags, or a prior source doc that inspected those materials. Ad names, file names, campaign names, ad-set names, creator nicknames, and naming-convention tokens are inventory handles only. They can locate, count, dedupe, or reveal account organization, but they cannot prove who appears, who the ad serves, what message it carries, what product it sells, what format it uses, or why it matters. If only a name or label is available, stop and pull the media through Parker MCP: `search_facebook_ads_sql` or `search_facebook_ads_semantic` for own-brand paid ads, `search_competitor_facebook_ads` for competitor paid ads, and `search_and_manage_organic_social` for organic posts. If the media still cannot be accessed, write `creative read unavailable`, put the gap in data limitations, and do not use that source in the finding. A label with a caveat is still a failed creative read.

**Be the exact picture of your slice — verbatim, not generalized.** This doc has to stand on its own. Someone who needs to know exactly what is happening in this slice should get the full answer from it, with no ambiguity left and the only open questions being the open loops. Specifics carry that; summaries do not. The exact phrase a customer or competitor used, not a paraphrase of the theme. The count with its denominator and window — how many times a phrase appears, the share a sentiment holds, how that splits — never "many," "several," or "tends to." The named example described richly enough to replay, not a category label standing in for it. A generalization is a claim the reader cannot check; the verbatim and the number are the evidence itself. A synthesis whose job is to point rather than hold the depth still owes an exact figure and an exact pointer on every claim it does make.

**Stamp the doc's freshness.** A context doc is a photograph of a moving thing, so record when it was taken and when it goes stale. In the output frontmatter set `generated_on` to today, read from `get_current_time`, and `refresh_by` to today plus this doc type's cadence in `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md`. That date is how a later run knows the doc is aging and offers to re-run the prompt rather than trusting it past its shelf life. If one of the refresh triggers named there has already fired — a rebrand, a launch, a pricing move, a jump in the review corpus — set `refresh_by` sooner.

**Write the output at a tenth-grade reading level.** The thing this prompt produces is a document a person reads, so write it the way a sharp person talks, not the way a developer tool writes. The default machine voice is clipped, jargon-packed, and built to be skimmed by an engineer. That is the wrong voice here. Override it. Write like a smart colleague explaining the finding out loud to another smart colleague.

Aim for a tenth-grade reading level. Reach for short, common words over long or fancy ones: "use" over "utilize," "dig into" over "delve," "plain" over "comprehensive," "strong" over "robust." Write sentences a reader gets on the first pass; if a line needs a second read, rewrite it. Vary the sentence length so it moves like speech, not like a spec sheet.

This is about the words, not the substance. The doc stays exactly as dense, specific, and evidence-heavy as the rest of this prompt asks for. Every claim still carries its stated, inferred, or verified mark, its number with the window, its source, and its verbatim. Talking plain is not thinking small. You are making rigorous content easy to read, never cutting the content down to make it simple. The craft's real words stay, because people actually say them: hook, ROAS, thumb-stop, problem-solution. Invented words jammed together into terms nobody says out loud do not.

**Never invent hyphenated compounds.** Jamming words together with hyphens to coin a modifier — "near-single-persona machine," "daily-symptom spine," "identity-restored cluster," "sit-in-the-problem register," "compliance-heavy ground" — is the single worst habit of the machine voice, and it is banned. Write the sentence instead: not "the account is a near-single-persona machine" but "nearly all the spend goes to one persona"; not "the daily-symptom spine" but "the everyday symptoms — itch, burn, soreness — that run through most reviews." If a phrase needs a hyphen you invented, the phrase needs rewriting. Three things this rule does not touch: real dictionary words that carry their own hyphen (post-menopausal, re-run, well-being), file names and doc slugs quoted as references (`persona-strategy-input.md` is a path, not prose), and a hyphenated term quoted verbatim from a source. And go easy on the em dash: one per paragraph reads like a person, a pileup reads like a model — when in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.

<!-- team-conversations:start (synced from prompts/_team-conversations-source-block.md; edit there, then run scripts/sync-open-loops-core.py) -->
**Read the team's past Parker conversations, when they exist. They are a real source for this doc.** If this team used the Parker web app before this brain was built, everything they told Parker there is evidence you would otherwise be missing: the positioning, the decisions already made, the constraints, the preferences, and the strategic thinking that never got written into a formal doc. Pull it with `search_chat_history`. Use `listThreads` to see what is there, paginating with the returned offset, then `getMessages` on the threads that matter. Web threads carry an `authorName`, so you can tell which teammate said what and attribute it. Read this the way this doc reads any source, for what the team stated about the brand, mined for the specific fact, the decision, the exact phrase.

Treat it by kind. A claim made in a conversation is **stated**, not verified. Carry it as the team's word, quoted with its author and date, until another source confirms it. Where a past conversation contradicts what the live data, the account, or the site actually shows, the conflict is the finding: surface it plainly and follow the evidence, and never launder a chat claim into a verified fact. And never let the team's own words in a chat stand in for the customer's; this source is the team on the brand, not voice-of-customer.

**If there are no past conversations, note it in one line and run as normal.** This source sharpens the doc. It is never a gate. A brand whose team never touched the web app still produces the full doc from every other source.
<!-- team-conversations:end -->

This produces `competitive-landscape.md`, one of the sub-context docs that feed the brand's narrative one-pager. It maps the full field of brands around this one and sorts them into the roles they play, so the rest of the competitor work knows who to audit deeply, who to merely watch, and who sits in the customer's wider category. It is the map and the router for everything competitive that follows.

You are a senior creative strategist drawing the map of the field a brand competes in and deciding where to point the deeper work. Write plainly and directly. Lead with what is true and why it matters.

## Use your judgment

You are a capable reasoner, but you are not a creative-strategy subject-matter expert, and that gap is part of what this prompt fills. This doc is a sorting job: you take the field of brands around this one and put each into the role it actually plays, then decide which few warrant a full deep audit. That sorting is a real read, so make it, and ground each placement in evidence. But know what this doc is not. It is not the deep teardown of any single competitor, that work has its own docs and happens separately, so resist the urge to start auditing here. And it is not the place to judge which rivals are worth studying creatively or how aggressively the brand should take them on in its advertising, those are creative-layer reads that happen downstream, not on this map. The guidance below is what an expert pays attention to, not a form to tick. Reason with it, follow what matters for this field, and surface what it did not anticipate.

## Where this doc sits

The brand's narrative one-pager, `brand-profile.md`, is the always-loaded summary of the brand. It is built from a set of sub-context docs, each one owning a single slice of the picture so that no doc has to do everything and nothing important falls through the cracks. Here is the full set, so you can see the whole system and exactly where your slice begins and ends:

- **Brand identity analysis** — what the brand says it is: its positioning, founder and origin story, the audience it claims, its tone and voice, its credibility markers, and the brand and claims guardrails it says it operates under, including what it can and cannot say and how it substantiates claims.
- **Operations and team** — who does the work, where they are bottlenecked, what they want automated, who owns strategy, media buying, and creative, how the ad account is run, and the marketing budget: how much is spent, how it splits across channels, and what is run in-house versus by an agency.
- **Website and product audit** — the full product line: every SKU, the hero products, the differentiators, known product issues, the upsell and lifetime-value path, and which use cases each product serves.
- **Organic channels inventory** — an inventory of the brand's own organic social across platforms and how strong each presence is, with the deep organic audit living in the organic-social team.
- **Performance targets and metrics** — the brand's targets, spend, benchmarks, and the scoreboard it judges paid and creative performance by, plus how its channels relate and how it attributes across them, including the retail-attribution gap.
- **Reputation analysis** — how the brand is perceived in the wild: search results, press, sentiment, and the authority it has earned.
- **Community and forums** — the deep mining of unprompted category and brand conversation for objections, vivid language, and gold nuggets.
- **Customer journey and persona discovery** — how people actually come to buy: the journey, the triggers, what they must learn, and what they love.
- **Category and market research** — the market the brand sits inside: its size, maturity, barriers, cultural currents, and category-wide trust events.
- **Competitive landscape** — this doc.
- **Marketing calendar and campaigns** — the brand's active and recent campaigns, its recurring seasonal moments, the major campaigns it has run, and the product launches and collaborations that shape when and around what it goes to market.

This doc owns the map of the field and the routing of the deep work. The deep, per-competitor teardowns live in their own competitor-snapshot docs, which are built separately for the few rivals that earn one. The market-wide conditions all these brands share belong to category and market research, and who the brand's own customer is belongs to the customer and persona work. Your job is to name and sort the players and decide where the heavy work goes, not to do that heavy work here.

Three competitive reads deliberately do not live here, because they are creative judgments rather than market mapping. Which brands are worth learning from creatively, and which brands the same customer already loves, are read in the competitor profile's ad-account work and confirmed by the customer and persona work, not guessed from the category at this altitude. And how far the brand is willing to go in directly taking on a rival in its own creative is a creative-strategy audit question, decided when a comparison play is actually on the table. Leave those to the layers that own them.

## What this doc is

This is the organizing map of every brand that matters to this one, sorted by the role each plays, and it is the router that points the heavier competitor work where it should go. It is not the deep audit of any rival, and it is not the creative read on any rival.

It matters because you cannot audit everyone, and pretending to try produces a thin read of many brands instead of a deep read of the few that count. Sorting the field by role is what lets the deep work concentrate where it pays off. And it matters because the brands around this one are not all the same kind of thing. Some compete head-on for the same purchase. Some solve a related problem one step over. Some are small and new but moving fast. Treating these as one undifferentiated pile loses the distinctions that make competitive work useful.

A few ideas govern how you sort the field.

Cover the field by the shape of what brands offer, not just by the biggest names. When a category has several distinct kinds of product or several distinct ways of solving the problem, the brands worth a deep audit should represent each of those, so the picture is complete across the ways a customer might go, rather than three versions of the same kind of rival. And among the brands worth deep work, the one that has held its lead over time usually deserves more attention than one fading into the crowd.

A count is not significance. The existence of many small brands does not make a category crowded if only a few actually matter to this brand. Weigh real competitive relevance over raw presence, and state your read.

## Goal and what success looks like

A finished version of this doc lets a reader who knows nothing about the field answer:

- Who the direct competitors are, sorted to a tight set of the few that warrant a full deep audit, chosen to cover the distinct kinds of product in the category and to include the durable leader.
- For each direct competitor, a one-line read of why it competes and what kind of threat it poses.
- Who the indirect and category-adjacent players are, and where one could become a direct threat.
- Who the emerging or micro-competitors are that warrant watching rather than a deep audit.

You are done when the field is correctly sorted and the deep-audit set is named, with each placement grounded in evidence and the gaps left as named blanks rather than guesses.

## How you work on this doc

**Why it exists.** A model arrives at any later task knowing almost nothing about this brand's rivals. So map the field clearly and sort it well, and write for a reader who knows nothing. Lean toward including a relevant player over omitting it, but do not pad with brands that do not matter. A clean, correct sorting is the goal, not a long list.

**Mark how you know each thing.** A claim is stated when a source asserts it, inferred when you concluded it from signals, and verified when real evidence confirms it. The role you assign a brand is a read, so mark it as yours and say what it rests on.

**A blank beats a guess.** When you cannot determine something, say so. Do not invent a competitor's strategy or a relationship the evidence does not support. A named blank tells the next person what to confirm.

**Carry the source.** For each placement, keep what it rests on, so a later reader can weigh it.

**Form.** Do not use parenthetical asides. Work the qualifier into the sentence or cut it. Do not describe what to capture by listing brand-specific examples to copy. Naming what to look for, like a competitor's role or the kind of threat it poses, is what you should do.

## Where to look

Map the field from public sources and from what the brand tells you, then widen the view yourself, because a brand's own list of competitors is a starting point that usually misses the indirect and the emerging entirely:

- The brand's own stated competitors, from intake or its materials, as a starting set.
- A scan of the category for who is actually present, who is rising, and who keeps coming up.
- Search and the public conversation, for how the field is framed and which rivals dominate it.
- Public ad libraries, for a fast read of which rivals are actually running creative and at what volume, which helps weigh how active a competitor is.

Sort what you find into the roles below, and mark clearly which brands are slated for deep audits versus only mapped here. Do not write a shallow full-audit from this altitude.

## What goes in it

Capture each of the following for this brand's field.

**Direct competitors.** The small number of brands that compete head-on for the same customer and the same purchase, the ones that warrant a full, deep audit each. Keep this set tight, a handful at most, and choose it deliberately so it covers the distinct kinds of product or approach in the category rather than several of the same kind, and so it includes the brand that has held its lead over time. For each, give a one-line read of why it is a direct competitor and what kind of threat it poses, and mark it as slated for a deep audit. The deep read on each, including whatever its creative is doing, happens in that audit, not here.

**Indirect and category-adjacent competitors.** The brands that solve a related problem or take a slice of the same need without competing head-on. They shape the customer's options and sometimes the customer's understanding of the category, even though they are not the primary rivals. Capture who they are and how they relate, and note where an adjacent player could become a direct competitor if it moved, since adjacency can close fast.

**Emerging and micro-competitors.** The small, new, or fast-moving brands not yet major but worth keeping an eye on. These get a distinct watch-closely role rather than a full audit, because they are not big enough to study deeply yet but are exactly the brands that, in a crowded category, are forced to compete on creativity and can surface a new angle or move quickly into relevance. Capture who they are and why they are worth watching, and note that the right cadence is a periodic check rather than ongoing deep analysis. In a heavily commoditized category, give these extra attention, because that is where the next real threat often comes from.

# Competitive landscape — [Brand Name]

## Direct competitors, the deep-audit set

## Indirect and category-adjacent competitors

## Emerging and micro-competitors to watch closely

## Open loops

## Appendix - Parker media links
```

Leave a clean named blank wherever you cannot determine a placement rather than a guess.

## Open loops

End with the few consequential questions the competitive-landscape mapping could not resolve.

## Parker media links appendix

End every context doc with `## Appendix - Parker media links` as the final appendix, after open loops and after any quote, customer-language, source, or evidence appendix. Include every Parker media link, media file path, thumbnail path, video URL, ad-library link, post link, source URL, or media reference that was available during the run and that supports an ad, post, hook, creator example, competitor example, visual source, or source artifact discussed in the doc. Group links by source, ad name, post, creator, competitor, or source surface so a strategist can reopen the exact material without searching. Preserve the original link or path exactly. If no Parker media links or media references were available, write `No Parker media links were available in this run.` Do not invent links, shorten paths, or replace links with descriptions.

This appendix is source infrastructure, not analysis. Do not move open loops into it, and do not count the appendix as a recommendation section. The body of the doc still needs narrative reconstruction of every important visual source; the appendix simply keeps the media handles attached at the bottom.

**The open-loops core rubric.** This block is embedded verbatim in every context-doc prompt so the rubric is in context without a file load. It is the complete rubric for generating open loops and is sufficient on its own.

A loop is a question about something Parker does not yet understand that would change what the brand does if Parker answered it. Open loops are observations first: things that caught Parker's eye during the research and left a real question behind. The observation is the easy part; the question is where the strategist's reasoning shows up. Think like a strategist. Ask like a smart 13-year-old. If the question sounds like it is trying to prove expertise, rewrite it.

Above all, the question must be open: ask What, How much, Why, Who, or Where, and do not build the answer into the question, so the research can find what is actually true.

The four territories are the essence of creative strategy. The foundation work exists to answer every question standing between Parker and knowing what this brand's creative strategy should be, and those questions land in four buckets. Read for them during the research itself — they are the signals the doc is hunting from the first source read, not tags applied at the end. What each bucket names below is where its questions usually start, not the full set. They are a map, not a cage — no list could hold every question a territory contains, so when something compelling surfaces that the examples do not name, that is a loop too. Follow it.

1. **Personas — are we advertising to the right people?** Read targeting from every angle at once. Who the brand is targeting now, both on purpose and where the algorithm actually delivers. Who its competitors are targeting, and who their creative says they want. Who the customer thinks the product is for, read from who reviewers recommend it to, buy it for, and describe themselves as. Who is missing — a buyer the data keeps surfacing that the creative never speaks to, a persona nobody in the category serves. And new use cases surfacing from a creator, a reviewer, or a comment thread that imply a buyer the brand has never named. The current targeting being right is a loop and being wrong is a loop. Highest-stakes territory, because the answer routes nearly everything downstream.

2. **Product — are we advertising the right product, in the right way, and does it make business sense?** The economics: which product leads, what the LTV looks like, whether the SKU the ads push is the one the business should be growing. The buyer journey: where people actually find this product, how a new buyer would discover it, whether discovery runs on word of mouth, retail shelf, search, social, or the feed, and where that journey leaks. Product sentiment: what people genuinely love, what they keep reaching for, what they quietly stop using. New use cases: ways people have started using the product that the brand never designed for or advertised, surfaced from a review, a comment thread, or a creator — a new job the product does, an occasion it has slipped into — each a possible new line of demand the marketing has never spoken to. This is the use case as a new application for the product, distinct from the personas read of whether it implies a new buyer. And persona fit: whether the product the advertising leads with is reflective of the personas the brand is targeting.

3. **Messaging — what is actually being said and shown?** The broadest territory, and the most observational: watch what the messaging is and is not, with curiosity. Read in three layers. The creative layer: the visuals, what is on screen, how the product is demonstrated and what the demonstration implies, the emotions the creative runs on, the pain points it speaks to, the claims it leads with. The language layer: what the brand says, what competitors say, what customers say and the exact adjectives they use, and where those three diverge. The volume layer: how much the brand is running and whether that is enough to learn from, how many winners it has found, what has been tried, and what has never been said.

4. **Creators and talent — who shows up on screen, and what does that say about the brand?** Whether the talent reflects the personas being targeted is the floor, not the whole territory. Who else should be on camera that never is. Who competitors are using as talent and what that choice is doing for them. What it says about the brand that these are the people showing up in its content. New angles or use cases a specific creator surfaces that the brand has never run. And the execution read: whether the brand has the right creators and talent to execute what personas, product, and messaging need, and where the gaps in the roster or the org sit.

The pull is the evidence that a loop is real and not a note. Name the pull on every loop and describe in one sentence how it fired — what specifically caught the eye and turned the observation into a question. The six pulls:

1. **Curiosity.** Parker encounters something unique — a category dynamic, a piece of customer language, a comparison, a competitor move, a cultural reference — that the rest of its context cannot yet explain. The pull is "what is this and why does it matter."
2. **Resonance.** Parker encounters something captivating — an emotional metaphor, a story inside a review, a clever piece of creative — and the loop is the why behind its strength. The pull is "this is good and I want to know why it works."
3. **Surprise.** Parker encounters something unexpected given all the context it holds. A number, a behavior, or a creative choice contradicts the prior the context built, and the size of that gap is the signal. The pull is "this is not what I would have expected."
4. **Tension.** Two sources disagree and cannot both be true as stated — brand self-image against delivery data, a claim against the reviews, a dashboard number against the story the team has been telling itself. The pull is "I want to know which is closer to right."
5. **Pattern.** The same thing keeps appearing across independent sources — a phrase, a use case, an objection, a competitor behavior. The pull is "this might be the start of something, and I want to see whether more evidence accumulates."
6. **Gap.** An absence where presence would be expected — a persona the brand has never tried, an angle that lives in the reviews but never in the ads, a lane nobody in the category runs. The pull is "there is data here, and nothing has ever been done with it."

The written form of a loop, in order: the observation in one or two sentences; the pull, named, with the one-sentence description of how it fired; the exact question; the justification — one or two sentences on why this is an open loop, meaning what would change for the brand if Parker answered it; and the territory tag. One open question per loop. Do not stack sub-questions or split into an either/or. Plain English a smart 13-year-old could understand. No jargon, no pre-specified test design, no future speculation — ask what signs exist today. No closure path, research plan, or media brief; closure belongs to the grading, hypothesis, and validation runs downstream.

Generation captures; grading decides. Do not pre-kill candidates here — a separate grading pass collects every doc's loops, consolidates them, scores them on the four weights, and routes what moves on. Only two checks apply at generation: an infrastructure item — a tooling gap, a data-pull failure, a missing source — routes to the data_limitations field instead of the loops, and an observation with no answerable question attached is a note, not a loop. Write every loop that carries a real pull and a real justification. If a territory is genuinely clean, leave it empty; never manufacture a loop to fill one.
<!-- open-loops-core:end -->

Doc-specific thinking lens. Loops on a competitive-landscape pass tend to cluster around two recurring real questions — whether an emerging or adjacent brand is on the verge of becoming a direct threat that warrants elevation to the deep-audit set, and whether an empty lane in the category is genuinely unclaimed or has been ruled out for a constraint not visible from the outside. The recurring pull pattern is the gap, where an absence in the field is itself the signal, and the question is which of the possible reasons explains the gap.

Loops do not cover: data on individual competitor follower counts, ad-library access for a specific rival, or routing decisions about which competitor gets a deep audit — those routing calls live in the doc body's deep-audit set, not in open loops. They also do not cover which rivals are worth studying creatively or the brand's appetite for comparison plays, since those are decided in the competitor profile and the creative-strategy audits.

## When you refresh this

The competitive field changes as brands rise, fade, pivot, and as new entrants appear, so the right sorting today may be wrong in a quarter. This doc is re-run on a quarterly cadence, with the watch-closely set checked more often when the category is moving fast. When you rebuild it, take the previous version in as context first, carry forward what still holds, and re-sort what moved. Pay special attention to the emerging and micro-competitors, since that is where change happens fastest and where a watch-closely brand can graduate into a direct threat that now warrants a deep audit. Say what each open loop's status is now.
