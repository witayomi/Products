# Brand-routines template — the stampable living loop

This is the factory-canonical **routine bundle** that `parker-system/prompts/onboarding-runner.md` stamps into every brand brain. It is what makes a shipped brain *self-running*: the moment the brain's folder lands on a machine (synced by Parker Desktop) and opens in Claude Code, the dreaming / self-improvement / idea / refresh routines are live, ready to be armed on a schedule.

Author the routines **here**, once. Do not hand-edit them per brand — when a routine's method changes, change it here and re-stamp, so every brain stays in sync. (This is the "clean long-term flow" the brand-instance `.claude/README.md` points at.)

## What's in the bundle

- **`claude/`** → stamped to the brand brain's **`.claude/`**. (Named `claude/` without the dot on purpose, so Claude Code does not treat the factory's own template as active config. The runner renames it to `.claude/` on stamp.)
  - `settings.json` + `hooks/` — the committed guardrails and hooks (brand-agnostic; Claude Code hooks, no relation to ad hooks). settings.json carries the deny rules that keep the `parker-system/` mount read-only, plus four hooks: `hooks/session-start.py` (SessionStart — catches an un-initialized mount and states the sync model in one line: files save to disk, the Parker Desktop app syncs the folder), `hooks/craft-context.py` (UserPromptSubmit — injects the live craft catalog from `parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md` into every turn, with the sources-receipt rule and a static fallback), `hooks/pull-log.py` (PostToolUse — the session pull log the grounding gate verifies), and `hooks/git-guard.py` (PreToolUse on Bash — on repos in Parker's `parker-brain` org it blocks the git commands that move history, the network, or the working tree against the brand repo, clones of managed-org URLs, and `gh` aimed at this repo, because Parker Desktop owns the sync — while letting the mount operations the brain uses (`git -C parker-system fetch`, its pin `checkout`, `git submodule update --init`), read-only git, and clones of other URLs (like the public factory) through; registered without the `2>/dev/null || true` wrapper because its exit code and stderr are the mechanism).
  - `README.md` — explains the two layers of a routine (job travels in the repo; schedule armed per-account).
  - `skills/` — the bundled skills, self-contained (no `parker-brain/...` paths at runtime). The first four are the scheduled routines; the last two are on-demand helpers:
    - `dream` — daily planning run over the day's comms → five-bucket proposals, captured verbatim (proposes, never applies).
    - `self-improve` — weekly governing pass: curates traces, disposes dreaming and research proposals with the human in the loop.
    - `research-loops` — the weekly research cycle: rolls up the open loops, advances promoted ones into hypotheses, runs the validations and due re-validations, and aligns the standing docs with the confirmed findings.
    - `harvest-ideas` → `evaluate-ideas` — the weekly idea cycle (capture verbatim, then grade against the roadmap).
    - `refresh-context` — re-runs docs past their `refresh_by`.
    - `update-brain` — the weekly standard check: on the standard layout it compares the pinned factory release against the newest tag and offers the bump (applying the factory's `migrations/` notes on a yes); on a decoupled brain it falls back to per-file compare-and-offer. Never overrides; the team's edits, deletions, and declines are remembered and respected.
    - `save-brain` — how the brain saves itself: the Parker Desktop app syncs the folder both ways, so writing files to disk is the whole job — no git against a managed brand repo, ever (repos are created in Parker Desktop and any tool-returned credentials are ignored; the carve-outs are mount operations inside `parker-system/` and the confirmed `/disconnect-factory` dissolution commands), what to do when the folder isn't syncing (point at the app, or let a technical team wire their own git), and the self-managed exception detected from the origin URL. The `git-guard` hook enforces the no-git rule.
    - `disconnect-factory` — the deliberate decoupling for teams that want to own and edit the method itself. Confirmation-gated.
    - `setup-routines` — one-time installer that arms the cron schedules in a fresh instance.
    - `get-started` — the first-run walkthrough: teaches a new user (or a teammate who just got the brain through Parker Desktop) what it knows, how to use it, and the single best first move, grounded in the brand's own data. On-demand and re-runnable; the runner invokes it live at hand-off.
- **`schedules/`** → stamped to the brand brain's **`schedules/`**. One recipe per routine (task, cron cadence, what it runs/reads/updates, deliverable, status, origin) plus the folder README. These are repo-native cron routines — **not** the Parker-MCP `workflows/` product surface (see `parker-system/system/schedules.md`).
- **`codex/`** → stamped to the brand brain's **`.codex/`** (same dot-rename trick as `claude/`). The OpenAI Codex twin of the guardrail layer: `config.toml` wires the same four hooks (delegating to the same `.claude/hooks/` scripts) plus a `mount-guard` PreToolUse hook and the `parker-brain` filesystem profile protecting the method mount. Change a hook in `claude/settings.json`, change it here in the same PR — `parker-system/system/codex-support.md` is the contract.
- **`AGENTS.md`** → stamped to the brand brain's repo root. Codex's entry point: routes to `CLAUDE.md` as the operating contract and carries the Parker voice (Codex has no output-style layer). Kept brand-neutral on purpose so the sync can keep updating it. The third Codex artifact — the `.agents/skills → .claude/skills` symlink that makes the same skills load in both harnesses — is created by the runner at stamp time (a symlink can't travel through the sync's blob copies).

## How it's stamped

`onboarding-runner.md` copies `claude/` → `.claude/`, `codex/` → `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md`, and `schedules/` → `schedules/` (plus creates the `.agents/skills` symlink), then de-genericizes: replace `[brand]` / "the brand" with the brand name where it reads naturally, and leave the brand-rule pointers (`CLAUDE.md`, `running-notes/brand-notes-from-org.md`) as-is, since those resolve inside the brain. The schedules ship as `status: not-yet-registered`. Codex builds leave scheduling explicitly deferred and finish with on-demand skills. Where Claude cloud scheduling is available, the runner's stamp step arms them — `/setup-routines` in build mode, all six at default cadences, disclosed plainly at the finish. A brain opened on a *new* cloud instance arrives un-armed (schedules are per-account), and the brand owner runs `/setup-routines` there to arm the cron; it's also the way to change a cadence or turn a routine off.

## The canonical method behind each routine

These skills are faithful distillations of the factory method docs — keep them in sync with:
- `self-improvement/the-living-loop.md` (the plan→execute spine + the five streams)
- `self-improvement/dreaming-system.md` (the planning arm, the day's-comms read, the verbatim rule)
- `parker-system/system/schedules.md` (repo-native cron vs MCP workflows)
- `parker-system/system/open-loops-system.md` (the loop lifecycle the `self-improve` roll-up runs)
- `parker-system/system/refresh-cadence.md` (what `refresh-context` acts on)
- `parker-system/prompts/ideas-and-briefs/` (what `harvest-ideas` / `evaluate-ideas` distill)

## Optional usage logging

The shared `scripts/usage-log.py` collector ships at the brand root with hooks for SessionStart, Stop, SubagentStop, and SessionEnd. Missing `usage_logging.enabled` in `parker_config.json` means off; only literal `true` enables it. `save-brain` exports metadata-only `.usage/` records before confirming sync; Parker Desktop saves those files, and live checkpoints stay ignored. Self-managed brains export before their own save. No setup or update enables logging. See `parker-system/system/usage-logging.md` for cache semantics, attribution, coverage, and hook trust.
