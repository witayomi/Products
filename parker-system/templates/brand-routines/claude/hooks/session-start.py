"""SessionStart hook for a brand brain: catch a broken method mount before work starts.

The brain's method (prompts, craft knowledge, system docs) lives at parker-system/,
a git submodule of the public parker-brain factory pinned to a release tag. A folder
that arrives without it (or with it empty) leaves every method reference dangling
until it is initialized. This hook checks the mount at session start.

Syncing is NOT this hook's job: the Parker Desktop app watches the brain's folder
and syncs every change both ways, so the hook only reminds the model of the model —
files save to disk, the app does the rest, never run git against this repo.
