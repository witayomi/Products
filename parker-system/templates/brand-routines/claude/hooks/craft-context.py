"""UserPromptSubmit hook for a brand brain: put the craft catalog in front of every turn.

A reminder to go read the catalog gets skipped; the catalog itself does not.
This reads the generated DOC-MAP table out of
parker-system/creative-strategy-context/expertise-routing.md (cwd is the repo
root when Claude Code runs hooks) and injects it, so the planner sees the menu
of method docs on every message instead of having to remember one exists.
Falls back to the plain instruction if the file is missing or unreadable.
