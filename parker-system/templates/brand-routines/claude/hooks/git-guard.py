"""PreToolUse guard for git operations in a Parker Brain repo.

A managed brain (one living in Parker's own parker-brain org) is synced by the
Parker Desktop app: it watches the folder and syncs every change both ways.
The agent's whole job is to write files — running git against the brand repo
(push, pull, clone, gh) means two sync engines fighting over one folder. This
hook blocks those moves at the moment of the mistake and teaches the right
one: save the files, the app does the rest.

Mount operations pass through: parker-system/ is a pinned submodule of the
public factory, and its local/public ops (submodule init, /update-brain's
fetch + checkout pin move) are the agent's job and need no credentials.

So do `git add`, `git commit` and `git merge` (v22). When the app pauses a
brain on a clash - the same lines changed here and by a teammate - its Fix
button merges the teammate's version in and leaves both versions in the
file, between the two-way markers (the app forces that style, so no diff3
base section ever appears); the agent's job is to edit the file until every
clash block is combined and none of its three marker lines is left, and the
app commits and shares the result by itself. Those three verbs let an
agent finish that by hand without being blocked mid-way; they are local, and
the app's next cycle treats a commit the agent made like any other. The
network verbs stay blocked: the agent holds no credentials for them anyway;
a `commit --amend` rewrites history the app may already have shared; and
`merge --abort` (or `--quit`) throws the combining away, which is the
person's call, made in the app, never the agent's.
A brain hosted anywhere else (the self-managed exception) is untouched —
the guard only speaks up when the repo's origin (or the command itself)
points at the parker-brain org, on GitHub or on Parker's git gateway.

Runtime procedure: .claude/skills/save-brain/ (/save-brain).
Design and rationale: parker-system/system/brain-sync.md.

Fail-open by design: any unexpected error exits 0 so a guard bug can never
brick every Bash call. Exit 2 blocks the tool call and shows stderr to the
model; exit 0 allows silently.

Run with --codex (the .codex/config.toml wiring does) and a block is emitted
as the PreToolUse JSON deny on stdout instead. Codex also supports exit 2;
the flag keeps its structured permissionDecision response explicit. Same
guard, same message, different envelope.
