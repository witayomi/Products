description: Decouple this brain from the public parker-brain factory so the team can develop their own version of the method. Converts the read-only parker-system/ submodule into plain files the team owns and can edit, removes the read-only guardrails, and flips the update posture so /update-brain stops offering pin bumps. Use when the team says they want to customize the method itself, own their prompts and craft docs, disconnect from Parker's updates, or go independent.

# Disconnect factory — make the method the team's own

## What this is and when to run it

The standard brain mounts the factory method at `parker-system/` as a read-only submodule pinned to a release: the team gets Parker's improvements by moving the pin, and never edits the method directly. Some teams outgrow that — they want to rewrite prompts, reshape craft docs, and develop their own version of the method. This skill is that decoupling, done cleanly and reversibly-in-git.

This is a real fork in the road, so it starts with a plain confirmation, never runs on inference. Explain what changes before anything happens:

- The method files become theirs to edit, versioned in this repo like everything else.
- They stop receiving factory releases as pin-bump offers. `/update-brain` switches to its decoupled mode: it can still *show* what the factory added and offer individual pieces, but nothing arrives whole anymore, and under full independence it goes quiet unless asked.
- Everything else — their data, skills, routines, schedules — keeps working exactly as before, because every path stays the same.

Then ask which of the two shapes they want (popup question form, one question):

1. **Own factory copy (keeps a road back).** They keep a private copy of the factory as their own repo, and this brain's submodule URL is repointed at it. They edit method there; they can still merge the public factory into their copy whenever they want Parker's improvements. Right for teams who want to customize *and* keep drawing on upstream.
2. **Full absorb (simplest, fully theirs).** The submodule is dissolved and the method files are committed directly into this repo at the same `parker-system/` path. No second repo, no submodule mechanics, no upstream link. Right for teams going fully independent.

## Option 1 — repoint at their own factory copy

1. They need a private copy of the public factory under their own control. A GitHub fork of the public repo cannot be made private, so it's a duplicate: bare-clone the public factory and push it to a new private repo they own. Walk them through doing it themselves — it's their own account and their own repo, outside Parker's managed storage, and their credentials stay theirs to handle.
2. Repoint the submodule: edit the URL in `.gitmodules` to their copy, then `git submodule sync parker-system` and verify `git -C parker-system remote -v`. On Parker Desktop, also check that the mount still fills on a teammate's machine: the app's access covers the brand's own repo, not a private factory copy, so a teammate's app may be unable to download it. If it can't, full absorb is the shape that works with the app.
3. Update `running-notes/standard-sync.md`: posture `own-factory`, their remote, the release currently pinned, and a line recording the decoupling date and reason.
4. Keep the deny rules **removed only if they ask** — under option 1 many teams still want the mount read-only in the brain and do their method editing in the factory copy itself. Ask; default is keep the rules. If they request an editable mount, remove both runtimes' mount restrictions and update both root contracts as in option 2, while preserving the submodule and its pin. Reload or restart each affected runtime, then perform option 2's harmless edit-and-restore check inside `parker-system/` using the normal daily permissions. Do not call the editable setup complete until that check passes.
5. Done — the changed files save like any other change (Parker Desktop syncs them; on a self-managed brain, the team commits them as one commit: `Decouple: repoint method at team factory copy`).

## Option 2 — full absorb

Do all of this in **one pass**, so the sync captures it as one coherent change. Reconnecting later means re-adding the submodule by hand; see the road-back note below.

1. Before changing either repository, require a clean parent index: `git diff --cached --quiet` must exit 0. If unrelated work is staged, stop and have the user save or separate it; never unstage, discard, or include it in this operation. Capture the pinned state next: record the release tag and exact commit (`git -C parker-system describe --tags` and `git -C parker-system rev-parse HEAD`) in the ledger. Verify the mount is populated and clean, and capture `git -C parker-system ls-files` plus the tracked files' contents for a before/after check. Save outstanding method edits before proceeding.
2. Dissolve the submodule but keep the files in place. Parker Desktop commits whatever it finds once the folder goes quiet, and a half-converted mount breaks the last step, so check the gitfile first and then run the gitlink removal, the gitfile removal, and the `git add` back-to-back in one chained command:
   - **Do not run `git submodule deinit`: it removes the working files.** Run `git rm --cached parker-system` to remove only the gitlink from the parent index.
   - Remove the `parker-system` entry from `.gitmodules` (delete that file only if it has no other entries).
   - Verify `parker-system/.git` is a gitfile, then remove only that file. Keep the resolved submodule Git directory under the parent Git metadata as recovery data. If `.git` is a directory instead, stop and preserve that metadata before converting; never recursively delete it.
   - Run `git add -- parker-system/` and `git add -u -- .gitmodules`. Verify the former submodule's tracked files are all present, unchanged, and now individually staged in the parent. If an ignore rule hides any, explicitly stage those previously tracked paths; do not commit an incomplete absorb.
3. Remove the four `parker-system` deny rules from `.claude/settings.json`. Also remove the mount-guard PreToolUse entry and the `parker-system` read-only filesystem entry from `.codex/config.toml`, preserving other hooks and the baseline permission profile. Update the read-only paragraph in root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the approved editable method. Restart Codex or reload its permissions before testing an edit; a running session may still hold the old policy. Verify a harmless edit and its restoration inside the absorbed method.
4. Update `running-notes/standard-sync.md`: posture `independent` (or `own-factory` in spirit if they say they still want offers), the fork-point release, date, reason.
5. Check the change with `git status` (and the latest sync commits, if Parker Desktop already saved part of it). It must contain only the absorbed method, `.gitmodules`, the runtime permission/contract edits, and the decoupling ledger. Stop if unrelated paths or edits appear. Then it's done — the absorbed files save like any other change (on a self-managed brain, the team commits them as `Decouple: absorb factory <tag> into the brain`).

## After either path

- Tell them plainly what changed and what to expect: `/update-brain` now runs in decoupled mode per its own skill doc, and method edits are theirs to make and version. The session-start hook adjusts itself — it detects the absorbed (non-submodule) state and switches to the decoupled message, dropping the pin and read-only language; no manual hook edit is needed. Under option 1 (repoint) the mount is still a submodule, so the hook keeps its standard message against their own remote.
- Honesty about the road back: reconnecting later is possible but manual — re-adding the submodule is easy, but any method edits they made in the meantime have to be carried over by hand. Say this at the confirmation step, not after.
- Log the decision through `self-improvement-intake` as a reasoning trace: teams decouple for reasons, and the reason is signal.

## Hard rules

- Never run without the explicit confirmation. "Can we edit the prompts?" is a question about this skill, not an instruction to run it — explain first, offer, wait.
- One pass per decoupling — never spread it across sessions. Keep local submodule metadata for recovery; a reconnection needs `git submodule update --init parker-system` once the submodule is re-added.
- Never decouple as a side effect of some other task hitting the read-only wall. If an edit inside `parker-system/` gets denied, the answer is to surface *why* it's read-only and mention this skill exists — not to run it.
