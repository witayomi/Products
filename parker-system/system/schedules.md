# Schedules — keeping a brand brain running on its own

A brand brain is a repository. Open its synced folder in a Claude Code instance and it is a living thing that can run jobs against itself. A **schedule** is one of those jobs: a cron routine that runs inside the brain to keep its docs current without anyone asking. The nightly dreaming pass, a weekly idea harvest, a refresh sweep over stale docs — each is a schedule.

This is the repo-native answer to "how does the brain stay alive when no one is typing." Dreaming proposes schedules (the third of its five buckets); self-improvement creates, edits, pauses, and removes them; and the routines themselves run on the back end against the repo.

## Schedules are not workflows

Keep these two apart — they look similar and are not the same thing.

- **Workflows** are a **Parker-MCP product** concept: a recurring task a user hands to the hosted Parker product, which runs it through the MCP surface. They live in `workflows/` and call out to the MCP.
- **Schedules** are **repo-native**: cron routines that run inside *this brand brain repo*, in a Claude Code instance, against the files in the repo. The *trigger* is a Claude Code scheduled agent — registered per-account by `/setup-routines`, firing from Anthropic's cloud infrastructure so it keeps running with the local machine off (what such a run can save is under "The runner" below); "repo-native" means the job works against this repo's files and needs nothing from the hosted Parker product. The job itself is a normal Parker session that uses any connected tool the skill needs, Parker MCP pulls included; a refresh that skipped the live data would just write stale docs. If the brain's folder is on your machine (synced by Parker Desktop, or a self-managed clone) and Claude Code points at it, the schedules are what would run to update the docs.

The distinction matters because the brand brain is meant to be portable. A workflow assumes the hosted product is in the loop; a schedule assumes only the repo and a Claude Code runner. When in doubt: if it keeps the *repo's own docs* fresh and needs nothing but the repo to run, it is a schedule.

## Schedules and the refresh cadence

`system/refresh-cadence.md` says *when* a doc goes stale — every doc stamps a `refresh_by`, and the aggregated view lives at `running-notes/refresh-schedule.md`. That is the **clock**. A schedule is the **worker that acts on the clock**: a refresh schedule wakes up, reads `running-notes/refresh-schedule.md`, finds what is overdue, and re-runs the generating prompt. Refresh cadence decides what is due; the schedule does the re-running. The two are complementary — cadence without a schedule still needs a human to notice and re-run; a schedule without cadence has nothing to check against.

Not every schedule is a refresh job. The other common ones:

- **Dreaming** — run the daily dreaming pass over the day's comms and write the proposals (see `self-improvement/dreaming-system.md`).
- **Idea harvest** — scan the configured inspo sources on a weekly cadence and log new `[~]` ideas to the bank.
- **Open-loops roll-up** — collect, weight, and route open loops on the roll-up cadence.
- **Refresh sweep** — re-run docs past their `refresh_by`.

## The `schedules/` folder

Each brand brain carries a `schedules/` folder, one file per routine, mirroring the shape of `workflows/`:

```
z-brands/[brand]/schedules/
    README.md
    [schedule-slug].md          ← an active, confirmed routine
    proposed/[schedule-slug].md ← dreaming-suggested, awaiting user confirmation
```

Each schedule file states:

- **Task** — what the routine does, in one line.
- **Cadence** — the cron expression and a plain-English reading of it ("0 6 * * * — every day at 6am").
- **Runs** — the prompt or skill it invokes.
- **Reads / updates** — the data sources it reads and the docs it writes.
- **Delivers** — what the user gets when it finishes (a proposal set, a refreshed doc, a notification).
- **Status** — proposed, active, paused, or retired.
- **Origin** — the dreaming run or conversation that proposed it.

A proposed schedule does not run until the user confirms it and it moves out of `proposed/`. Pausing a schedule keeps the file and flips its status; removing one archives the file with its reasoning, so a retired routine still teaches what was tried.

## The runner

The routines run as **Claude Code scheduled agents** — the `/schedule` skill and the cron machinery behind it. The repo carries the *definition* of each schedule (the `schedules/` file); the Claude Code instance where the brain's folder is opened carries the *execution*. Standing up a schedule means writing its file here and registering the matching cron routine in the instance; the two stay in sync, with the file as the source of truth for what the routine is supposed to do.

As of July 2026, confirm which `/schedule` you're actually getting — Claude Code's CLI and Desktop app run separate scheduling systems (one works in the cloud, another on the user's machine), and only the cloud one survives the machine being off; see `setup-routines/SKILL.md` for the caveat.

**A cloud routine can't save to a managed brain, and it never could.** Anthropic's cloud environments restrict git, so a cloud routine couldn't push to a brain in Parker's `parker-brain` org under the old git flow either (`stated`: maintainer note, 2026-09-15). Parker Desktop doesn't change that, because no app runs beside a cloud copy. The run itself still works, but its writes are saved only when the routine runs where the brain's sync is wired: for a managed brain, a folder Parker Desktop syncs, such as a local scheduled task on a machine with the app open; for a self-managed brain, wherever the team's own git sync runs. A cloud run says plainly that its output wasn't saved, per `save-brain`.
