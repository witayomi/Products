# Context update candidates - Claude creative strategy OS and reasoning traces

## Candidate summary

This source introduces a distinct Parker architecture lesson: the system should not only generate outputs from context. It should preserve why strategic decisions, edits, approvals, and rejections happened so the intelligence layer compounds over time.

This should not become a full product rebuild from one expert source. It should become a candidate principle across Parker's memory, skill, prompt, and database design.

## Proposed context updates

### 1. CLAUDE.md - add reasoning traces as a build principle

**Target path:** `CLAUDE.md`  
**Proposed change:** Add a project-level rule that Parker should optimize for context architecture, business-case-backed builds, and reasoning traces.  
**Evidence:** The source argues that useful AI operating systems log the reasons behind strategic decisions and hypothesis edits.  
**Confidence:** mixed, but strongly aligned with Jimmy's repeated feedback that Parker should learn holistically.  
**Promotion condition:** Applied immediately as a lightweight operating principle because it matches existing project direction.
**Status:** applied in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 2. Parker system map - make reasoning traces explicit

**Target path:** `system/parker-system-map.md`  
**Proposed change:** Add reasoning traces as a named memory or learning surface: strategic decisions, hypothesis edits, prompt/context rules, and user correction reasons.  
**Evidence:** The source names reasoning traces as the most valuable layer in a self-learning creative strategy OS.  
**Confidence:** mixed  
**Promotion condition:** Apply when Parker's memory architecture gets its next pass.
**Status:** applied as a v1 self-improvement surface in `system/parker-system-map.md`.

### 3. Master file structure - add reasoning-trace storage lane

**Target path:** `system/master-file-structure.md`  
**Proposed change:** Add or clarify where reasoning traces live. Candidate buckets: strategic decisions, hypothesis edits, context rules, prompt correction reasons, and creative-framework edits.  
**Evidence:** The source's OS buckets reasoning into strategic decisions, hypothesis edits, and context rules.  
**Confidence:** mixed  
**Promotion condition:** Apply when Jimmy approves the memory shape or when the first actual reasoning-trace workflow is built.
**Status:** applied as `self-improvement/` after Jimmy requested a self-improving method.

### 4. Update Parker skill - preserve why, not only what

**Target path:** `skills/update-parker-skill/`  
**Proposed change:** When Jimmy corrects Parker, capture the underlying rule and the reason for the correction, then route it to prompts, skills, context docs, or memory surfaces.  
**Evidence:** The source says systems improve when they ask why a strategist made a change and log that reason.  
**Confidence:** strong alignment with existing Jimmy feedback  
**Promotion condition:** Apply with the next update-parker-skill refresh.

### 5. Scriptwriting and grading skills - add learning loops

**Target paths:** `skills/scriptwriting/`; future grading skill surfaces  
**Proposed change:** Grading should diagnose, prioritize, rewrite, rescore, compare against the original, and explain why changes were made. It should teach the strategist, not only pass or fail the script.  
**Evidence:** The source describes a script grading skill with scored criteria and iterative improvement.  
**Confidence:** mixed  
**Promotion condition:** Apply when script grading or concept grading becomes an active Parker skill.

### 6. Database specs - framework hypotheses and edit feedback

**Target paths:** `prompts/global-databases/brand-swipe-file.md`; future AI-tagged ads DB specs  
**Proposed change:** Best performers, hooks, and competitor winners should store not only the framework and winning elements, but also Parker's hypothesis for why they worked and any human correction to that hypothesis.  
**Evidence:** The source describes best-performer and hook databases that store frameworks, hypotheses, and strategist edits.  
**Confidence:** mixed  
**Promotion condition:** Apply during database spec refresh.

### 7. Patterns-to-monitor - add AI creative strategy OS patterns

**Target path:** `creative-strategy-context/parker-taste/patterns-to-monitor/INDEX.md`  
**Proposed change:** Track selective context retrieval, reasoning traces, grading loops, psychological diversity analysis, and data-connected creative skills as emerging operating patterns.  
**Evidence:** The source gives multiple examples across scriptwriting, reporting, grading, and operating-system design.  
**Confidence:** mixed  
**Promotion condition:** Applied as watch item.

## Status

Partially applied. `CLAUDE.md`, `system/parker-system-map.md`, `system/master-file-structure.md`, and the new file-backed `self-improvement/` loop now absorb the lightweight reasoning-trace principle. Larger app/runtime changes should still wait for implementation planning and explicit approval.
