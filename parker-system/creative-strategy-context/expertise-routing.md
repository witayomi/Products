# Expertise routing — which creative-strategy-context docs each doc type loads

> Status: `[~]` drafted 2026-06-11 from Jimmy's correction: generated docs followed process without loading the domain expertise, so the analysis read as generic-AI rather than strategist-led. This map names the required creative-strategy-context reads per doc family. The synced expertise core block in every generating prompt points here. The reads are mandatory before analysis, not optional references — the analysis is performed *through* these methods, in their vocabulary.

Paths are relative to `creative-strategy-context/` in whichever tree is running (the factory root, or `parker-system/` inside a brand brain). Where a brand lens exists (`brand-lens.md` at the brand brain's root), load it after the generic docs — it bends the rules for this brand.

## The doc catalog — what exists, so you can reason over all of it

This is the catalog of every creative-strategy method doc and an honest line on what each one *is*. It is deliberately **descriptive, not prescriptive** — it does not tell you when to pull a doc or what it's related to, because those are guesses that go stale and quietly cap what you'd consider. Relevance is *your* call as the planner: read the catalog, hold the task in mind, and reason like a strategist about which docs would genuinely help — generously, biased toward pulling more. It is generated from each doc's `summary` frontmatter by `scripts/build-doc-map.py`, so it stays honest as the corpus grows. (The sections further down are keyed to *build tasks*, when you already know which doc you're generating; this catalog is for when someone just asks a question.)

How to use it:

- **Reason over the whole set, generously.** Don't match a label — look at what each doc actually is and pull everything that would make the answer better. A real question usually wants several, often across areas (a hook question that's really about a persona's emotional state pulls hooks *and* the persona and emotional-delivery docs). There's no quota and no cap; under-retrieval is the failure mode.
- **The catalog is a starting point, not the boundary.** A one-line summary can't capture everything in a doc. When the task is gray, novel, or specific, grep the actual doc bodies across `creative-strategy-context/` for the question's concepts and open what surfaces — the docs' own words find what a summary didn't mention.
- **An opened doc beats an assumption.** If you're unsure whether a doc is relevant, open it and look; the cost of reading one more is small, the cost of a generic answer is not.

Many of these docs end with a required sign-off line ("This is everything I know about X"). That stamp is a proof-of-read: if you used a doc, its sign-off must appear. A missing sign-off on a doc the question clearly needed is a tell that you skipped the read.

**Not reasoning docs — never pull these for analysis:** `expertise-routing.md` (this catalog), `brand-brain-CLAUDE-template.md` (a copy of the operating contract). They live in the folder but carry no method.

| `algospeak.md` | Algospeak and platform content policy — the coded language creators use to get sensitive topics past moderation, how enforcement differs across TikTok and Meta, category playbooks for cannabis/CBD, adult wellness, harm reduction and mental health, crypto, and body image / sex ed, and the compliance guardrails that keep a brand's account alive. |
| `analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` | How to analyze public ad accounts — impression-rank as a proxy, volume/recency/variant reading, and the library-vs-live-spend distinction. |

| `creative-consumption-analysis.md` | The per-persona method for characterizing the organic content a persona already watches — creator type, production level, setting, delivery, format — then reverse-engineering that native aesthetic into a casting and production brief so ads blend in to stand out. |
| `creative-strategy-by-brand-size.md` | How creative strategy shifts with brand spend level — the different priorities and plays at roughly $10k, $50k, and $1m per month: getting shots on goal and finding angles at the low end, founder ads and new-audience reach in the middle, and big net-new creative swings and new-persona unlocks at scale. Also who should be making the ads at each level — founder-first, when to hire a part-time strategist vs an agency, and diversifying creative sources ('rivers') at scale. |
| `creative-strategy-fundamentals.md` | The senior-strategist priors — confidence before speed, the kill-list discipline, where curiosity tends to land, the trying-too-hard failure modes. |
| `creator-briefs.md` | How to write creator briefs — the freedom-vs-direction call (freestyle vs director briefs), the talent gate (bottom 90% of creators need a script, top 10% do better free), why authorities earn more freedom, the category gate (regulated products get scripts, experience products get structure), the script-the-hook-only rule and first-frame specificity, the authenticity valve on full scripts, clear references, a shared creator-terminology vocabulary, story structure, why not to over-systemize briefing, and how to source and keep creators who can yap. |
| `customer-review-mining-method.md` | How to mine customer reviews and comments for creative material — golden nuggets, denominators, theme rates, the qualifying signals (metaphors, insider if-you-know-you-know phrases, trigger events, transformations), and the whole-review concept including the review-as-primary-text play. |

| `gifting-and-q4-creative.md` | The execution layer for gifting-season and Q4 creative — why the gift buyer is a different person than the user, the depth-over-breadth persona call heading into peak, mapping the gifting journey and its relational directions, a suggested (not settled) phase model for a Q4 sale running from planner-persona education through the holiday-sale cutoff and into concurrent Q1 prep, reading pre-season months as signal rather than ROAS, the adaptation ladder that turns evergreen and past-sale winners into sale creative, and offer honesty as a compounding asset. |
| `hook-psychology.md` | The cognitive science beneath hooks — the mechanisms (notice, qualify, intrigue, reassure, move, transport) that explain why a hook works. The why-layer under the format taxonomy. |
| `hooks.md` | The reference taxonomy of hook formats with real examples — the named formats and what each one is. |

| `killer-performance-ads.md` | What a genuinely great performance ad looks like — the bar that creative and opportunities get graded against. Carries the full ugly-ads doctrine: what ugly actually means (mimicking the customer's organic feed), the fake-ugly tells, first-frame believability and setting-as-relevance, the barbell rule (super ugly or super obvious ad — the middle dies), and the AI-replication moat. |
| `legal-ai-ugc.md` | The legal disclosure rules for AI-generated people in ads — the core principle (disclose synthetic humans, not AI products or backgrounds) and New York's S.8420-A, the first US law requiring it: what it covers, who's liable, the penalties, what 'conspicuous' means, and why the answer is labeling AI creative, not abandoning it.

| `lifestyle-video-ad-formats.md` | The library of video ad formats for lifestyle-positioned brands. |
| `new-product-launches.md` | How to build launch creative for an established brand's new product or SKU — what counts as genuinely new (and what is only a restock or a promotional wrapper), the classifier (Step Zero), the three launch scenarios (depth / bridge-and-expand / audience-expansion), why brand authority transfers along some axes and not others, the diagnostic, awareness-stage and proof strategy, and per-format output specs. Covers new SKUs, colorways, formats, bundles, spinoffs, and new-audience entries. |

<!-- DOC-MAP:END -->

## Own ad-account reads

Performance reports and audits (weekly, monthly, 90-day), performance-targets-and-metrics, whitespace:
- `ad-account-analysis.md` — the canonical own-account reading method
- `ad-metrics-glossary.md` — plain-language definitions of the Meta metrics the read leans on; pull it when a number's meaning or calculation is in question
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — what a genuinely great ad looks like, the bar every read grades against
- `andromeda-v2.md` — how Meta's delivery system behaves, so delivery patterns are read as auction mechanics rather than mysteries

Hook audits, any read of openers, and any feedback or critique on a video ad or a hook:
- `hook-psychology.md` — the canonical why-layer; the lead doc for generating hooks and for giving feedback/critique on a hook or video ad. Reason from its mechanisms (notice / qualify / intrigue / reassure / move / transport) and diagnose a weak hook by which job it fails — before reaching for format labels
- `hooks.md` — the hook format taxonomy and examples; name the real format and ground the read in its examples. A hook read that never uses its named concepts failed
- `emotional-delivery-and-timing.md` — the layer beneath hooks: the emotional state the viewer lands in, valence/intensity, and the TEEP phase she's in. Load it when the hook has to match a mood or a decision phase, not just create an emotion
- `ad-account-analysis.md`
- `ad-formats/` — the format taxonomy (video, static, both); name real formats from it
- `ai-writing-tells.md` — when the task *generates* hooks rather than reading them, the generated lines pass the lint-then-judge review before output

Selecting which ads to iterate on (account-level "what should we iterate on," before any specific ad is named):
- `selecting-ads-to-iterate-on.md` — the selection method: spend-in-account-context, run time, the breakdown effect, the promo caveat, slow-burner vs high-riser, 60-day trends. This is Phase A of the `iterations` skill, which then flows into Phase B (making the iterations) using `iterations.md`
- `ad-account-analysis.md` — the own-account reading method the selection grades against

Iteration reads (biweekly iterations report, iteration recommendations anywhere):
- `iterations.md` — the iteration doctrine
- `ad-account-analysis.md`
- `ai-writing-tells.md` — when the iteration produces new copy (hooks, headlines, script lines), that copy passes the lint-then-judge review like any other creative deliverable

90-day creative-strategy audit and diversity audit:
- `killer-performance-ads.md`, `ad-account-analysis.md`, `hooks.md`, `ad-formats/`, `iterations.md`
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — the served-vs-buyer read lives here

Visual-vocabulary generation — building the brand's `sub-context-docs/visual-vocabulary.md`:
- `visual-vocabulary-method.md` — the canonical method: in-play/adjacent/out-of-play classification, the script-congruence and format-dependence rules
- `ad-formats/` — the format taxonomy the visual grammar is read against
- `hooks.md` — the opener taxonomy, so visual hooks are named
- `analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` — for the rival visual reads that source adjacent and out-of-play candidates
- `organic-social-analysis.md` — for the brand's own organic, where in-play and adjacent shots are seen

## Competitor and external reads

Competitor ad-account evaluations, creative landscape, top-impressions reports, single-competitor ad analysis, external 90-day audits:
- `analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` — the canonical rival-library method: impression-rank as proxy, volume/recency/variant reading, library-vs-live-spend distinction
- `hooks.md`, `ad-formats/`
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — the bar for judging what a rival's winner actually is

## Customer language and persona reads

Customer review audits, review-sourced persona and VoC docs:
- `customer-review-mining-method.md` — the canonical mining method: golden nuggets, denominators, theme rates
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md`

Persona source pulls, personas-profile, voice library, lifecycle maps, bias notes:
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — identity-first persona doctrine, served-vs-buyer, the diagnosis
- `emotional-delivery-and-timing.md` — the canonical definition of TEEP (Trigger → Exploration → Evaluation → Purchase), required wherever the persona docs emit a "T-E-E-P content angle map" or "T-E-E-P decomposition," so the phases are reasoned from a real model rather than the acronym alone

VoC extractions and assembly:
- `customer-review-mining-method.md`
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md`

## Organic and niche-feed reads

Organic channel inventories and organic audits:
- `organic-social-analysis.md`
- the video-format doc matching the brand's positioning: `lifestyle-video-ad-formats.md` and/or `problem-solution-video-ad-formats.md` — check the brand's actual positioning before choosing; many brands need both

TikTok mining:
- `adapting-scripts.md` — the adaptation method is the whole point of the doc
- `hooks.md`, plus the video-format docs above

## Ideation, briefs, and creative generation

Idea bank, idea evaluation, sprint plan, brief creation, concepting:
- `ideation-and-brainstorming.md`, `iterations.md`, `scriptwriting.md`
- `emotional-delivery-and-timing.md` — for brief creation especially: the TEEP phase and the from→to emotional shift are required brief inputs, and the funnel-as-emotional-arc lens shapes how variations diverge
- `creator-briefs.md` — for brief creation: the freedom-vs-direction call (freestyle vs director briefs), the role of references, the shared creator terminology, and giving the creator a story structure to build on
- `creative-consumption-analysis.md` — the per-persona read of the native content a persona already watches, reverse-engineered into a casting and production brief

Idea evaluation specifically also loads, because it grades the captured pile against the strategy rather than capturing it:
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — so each idea's persona and served-vs-buyer read is graded, not assumed
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — so every evidence band grades against the real bar
- `creative-strategy-fundamentals.md` — the priors that order confidence before speed and the kill-list discipline

Sprint plan specifically also loads, because it sizes and splits a round against the account's real production reality rather than grading ideas:
- `ad-account-analysis.md` — the own-account reading method behind the round-sizing math: the spend read and the net-new-evergreen cadence, promotional creative stripped out
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — the diagnosis and the served-vs-buyer read that set the SKU split and the confidence-ranked persona allocation
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — the bar behind the two live reads: what is already working (double down) and what has been tried and failed (avoid)
- `creative-strategy-fundamentals.md` — the priors underneath sizing: confidence before speed, and the discipline that every concept in the round names a hypothesis
- `emotional-delivery-and-timing.md` — so each concept's doorway and leading emotion are set from a real model, not a label

Scriptwriting — any task that produces spoken words for an ad:
- `spoken-script-voice.md` — the human-voice doctrine and the brand voice-profile method; mandatory before writing any script's words, and the AI-tells audit runs on every draft
- `ai-writing-tells.md` — the written-slop sign families and the lint-then-judge review; every creative deliverable passes it before shipping, via the `creative-voice-review` agent and `scripts/voice-lint.py`
- `visual-vocabulary-method.md` — the visual twin of the voice profile; per-beat visual direction sources from the brand's `sub-context-docs/visual-vocabulary.md`, each beat marked in-play, adjacent, or out-of-play, with the script-congruence and format-dependence rules
- `visuals.md` — the why-layer beneath the visual-vocabulary method: how the visual carries the message with sound off and copy skimmed, and the eight principles that decide whether the ad is even seen
- `creative-consumption-analysis.md` — the persona's native-content read, so casting and on-screen situations blend into her feed
- `creator-briefs.md` — when the script hands off to a creator, the terminology and story-structure the brief needs
- `scriptwriting.md`, `adapting-scripts.md`

Headline and static generation:
- `spoken-script-voice.md` — the AI-tells list applies to headlines too
- `ai-writing-tells.md` — the written-slop signs are the primary check for headlines and statics; the lint-then-judge review runs before output
- `visual-vocabulary-method.md` — generated visuals source from the brand's `sub-context-docs/visual-vocabulary.md`; in-play shots ground the generation prompt, out-of-play visual inventions get flagged
- `lifestyle-headline-generator.md` or `problem-solution-headline-writer.md` by brand positioning
- `static-ad-design.md` — the design psychology of statics: the milliseconds-long eye scan, the visual-hierarchy call, message-image congruency, the money-shot, and where social proof goes. Statics have hooks too
- `visuals.md` — the eight principles that decide whether a static is even seen, the why-layer under the design rules
- `ai-static-ad-generation.md`, `static-ad-recreation.md` where statics are produced
- `ai-animation-prompting.md` — when the asset is AI-animated, how animation prompting differs from static-image and Veo-style video prompting
- `legal-ai-ugc.md` — when the generated asset shows a synthetic human, the disclosure rules (the answer is labeling AI creative, not abandoning it)

## Brand-and-task modifiers — pull when the brand or the task fits

These docs don't belong to one task family. They bend the read when the brand or the moment matches, and they cut across the creative-generation and strategy work above — hooks, headlines, scripts, statics, ideation, the account read, and the persona and messaging calls. Reason over them the way you reason over the catalog: pull the ones the brand or task actually calls for, and don't force a fit where there isn't one.

- `advertising-luxury-and-higher-price-points.md` — when the brand is luxury-positioned or priced above its category average: the two axes, the brand-element constraints, and price-objection handling
- `advertising-to-older-audiences.md` — when the target skews roughly 50–70: the messaging, pacing, hooks, visuals, tone, and social-proof patterns that win, and the common misreads
- `non-problem-solution-creative.md` — when the product is bought for transformation, emotion, or belonging rather than to fix a pain: why agitation misfires and what to sell instead
- `creative-strategy-by-brand-size.md` — when the plan depends on spend level: the different priorities and plays at roughly $10k, $50k, and $1m per month
- `seasonality.md` — when the task lands near a gifting window or seasonal peak: how the buyer, angle, and SKU shift, why evergreen winners stay on, and how to find which seasons actually matter
- `new-product-launches.md` (with its SKU-case pointer `new-sku-launch.md`) — when the task is launch creative for an established brand's new product, SKU, colorway, format, bundle, spinoff, or new-audience entry
- `algospeak.md` — when the category faces platform moderation risk (cannabis/CBD, adult wellness, harm reduction, mental health, crypto, body image): the coded-language and compliance guardrails that keep the account alive

## Syntheses

Brand-profile narrative, competitor snapshots, working thesis, gaps-opportunities-inspo, strategic roadmap, open-loops roll-up:
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — the diagnosis discipline
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — so opportunity claims grade against the real bar
- `creative-strategy-fundamentals.md` — the open-loops reasoning layer: the senior-strategist priors, where curiosity tends to land, the posture moves that sharpen a question, and the trying-too-hard failure modes. Load it wherever loops are graded or strategic forks are drawn.
- plus the family docs of whatever upstream surfaces the synthesis reads (an ad-account-heavy synthesis loads the ad-account methods)

## Phase-2 strategy inputs

The four reads that resolve each territory's Phase-1 evidence into a committed recommendation for the strategic roadmap. All four load the synthesis core above; each also loads its territory's methods.

Persona strategy input — the WHO call:
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — the served-vs-buyer read and the identity-first diagnosis that decide who to target
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — so the lead-persona call grades against the real performance bar
- `ad-account-analysis.md` — so delivery is read as who the account actually converts, not who the brand believes it targets

Messaging strategy input — what the brand should say:
- `creative-strategy-fundamentals.md` — the cross-read between what the brand says, what the customer says, and what the field rewards, where the message lives
- `customer-review-mining-method.md` — so the recommended lane is built from measured customer language, not brand echo
- `hooks.md`, `ad-account-analysis.md` — so the register and proof the account rewards are read from real openers and real winners
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — the bar the recommended message has to clear

Creator and talent strategy input — who should be on screen:
- `persona-research-and-creative-strategy-process.md` — so on-screen people are read against served-vs-buyer evidence, not casting assumptions
- `killer-performance-ads.md` — so talent proof is graded against the real bar for performance creative
- `ad-account-analysis.md` — so spend, delivery, frequency, and performance are read as Meta account behavior
- `andromeda-v2.md` — so creator and talent choices are read as creative-diversity signals, not only representation or credibility
- `visual-vocabulary-method.md` — so on-screen people, settings, proof moves, and first-frame visuals are reconstructed rather than labeled
- `analyzing-public-ad-accounts.md` — so competitor talent reads use rival library evidence correctly

## The test

Before emitting, re-read your analysis against the loaded docs: does it use their named concepts, taxonomies, and vocabulary where they apply? A doc that routes to a method but does not speak its language proves the method was never opened, and the run failed regardless of how complete the output looks.

For creative deliverables, this test is no longer self-graded. The `context-grounding-review` agent (`.claude/agents/context-grounding-review.md`) runs it independently as a ship gate: it derives what should have been loaded and pulled for the task from this catalog, the brand vault, and the tool inventory, runs the deterministic checks in `scripts/grounding-check.py` (verbatims trace to the vault, cited sources exist on disk, receipts present), and diffs the output's *evidence* — its vocabulary, not its claims — against that read. A `bounced` verdict sends the work back for re-pulls and regeneration. Sign-off stamps remain the proof-of-read convention, but they are corroboration the gate verifies, not proof on their own.
